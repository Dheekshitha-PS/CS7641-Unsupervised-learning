1794,"donald trump must shut federal reserve start issuing debtfree money   th  
if donald trump truly wants fix economy must shut federal reserve tries patch current system fail fundamentally flawed beginning little century ago powerful forces wall street convinced congress completely restructure financial system immensely powerful central bank known federal reserve created goal transform us dollar debtbased currency would continuously inflated create endless debt spiral   could never possibly escape sadly successful counts since creation federal reserve value us dollar declined approximately  percent national debt gotten  times larger  
americans tend give credit blame performance us economy presidents truth unelected unaccountable group central bankers far power economy anyone else federal reserve become known  fourth branch government  unlike branches government told feds decisions politics important fed officials fiercely guard independence fiercely resist interference congress president american people 
donald trump try lower taxes reduce regulations able influence economy pales comparison immensely powerful tools fed wields fed controls interest rates fed controls money supply fed regulates banks 
to give idea enormously powerful fed want pull dollar bill 
as look dollar bill want notice says federal reserve note right top 
in financial world note instrument debt truth system designed create much debt possible 
so using debtbased federal reserve notes first place shouldnt congress control currency 
according article section  us constitution  congress authority coin money regulate value thereof foreign coin fix standard weights measures 
so fed get involved 
well long convoluted story interested history behind would commend excellent book c edward griffin entitled  creature jekyll island second look federal reserve  basically big money interests wall street got hooks white house congress rushed legislation right christmas  created insidious central banking system designed slowly surely take wealth american people put hands 
sadly americans dont even realize debtbased currency understand money comes previous article  discussed money normally created federal reserve current system 
when us government decides wants spend another billion dollars print billion dollars 
rather us government creates bunch us treasury bonds debt takes federal reserve 
the federal reserve creates billion dollars thin air exchanges us treasury bonds 
the federal reserve takes us treasury bonds receives exchange federal reserve notes gave government auctions bonds highest bidder  course process always creates debt money 
the us treasury bonds federal reserve receives exchange money created nothing auctioned federal reserve system 
but wait 
there problem 
because us government must pay interest treasury bonds amount debt created transaction greater amount money created 
so us government get money pay debt 
well theory get money circulate economy really really fast tax high enough rate government able collect enough taxes pay debt 
but never actually happens 
and creators federal reserve understood well understood us government would enough money run government service national debt knew us government would keep borrowing even money attempt keep game 
so debt keeps going barack obama white house national debt risen  trillion dollars moment sitting  trillion dollar mark  
but shouldnt surprised precisely federal reserve system designed us 
many conservatives still hold mistaken illusion could somehow pay debt back someday shown previous article mathematically impossible  
if government went today grabbed every single dollar existence could pay back national debt course   household debt   corporate debt   state local government debt need pay back well 
under current system hope keep wheel spinning continuing devalue dollar continuing go even greater amounts debt 
and course isnt united states predicament point almost every single nation entire planet central bank 
even though extremely sharp disagreements among nations virtually everything else somehow central banking achieved nearly universal adoption 
as read article well  population globe lives country central bank 
do think coincidence 
of course still small countries federated states micronesia central bank big nation one north korea 
and would literally insane want live north korea 
but opportunity get free insidious system truth dont central bank fact greatest period economic growth us history central bank  
we dont need central planners set interest rates manipulate money supply never admit reality matter interference economy often creates tremendous economic busts 
since federal reserve created   distinct recessions depressions                    
considering track record isnt time change 
and dont debtbased currency fact long ago president decided start issuing debtfree united states notes 
back  president john f kennedy issued executive order  authorized us treasury issue debtfree united states notes directly created us government 
he assassinated shortly thereafter 
most americans dont realize many debtfree united states notes issued president kennedy still circulation today  president trump could something similar 
but 
it said borrower servant lender federal reserve system turned us debt slaves 
debt form social control global elite use debt dominate planet total amount debt world hit    trillion dollars  longer allow central banks control system bigger debt bubble become 
  united states starts shutting   issuing debtfree currency would take someone bold make move like let us hope man elected task"

it human nature want accumulate wealth also human nature want keep one ways wealthy influencing political process ensure favorable democratic republic particularly easy influence wealthy elite buy candidates donations superpacs make voting patterns favorable changing countrys demographics influence voters supposedly unbiased news media control us wealthy elite use every one levers rig system
for example liberal voters often favor progressive tax system high earners pay greater percentages earn less sounds like populist policy progressive taxation put place prevent middle class people rising ranks truly wealthy already accumulated wealth taxed much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps rich top keeps plebs thats matter political party power still stuck progressive taxation

the first way election rigged voter fraud gettysburg address trump outlined ways occurs
according pew  million voter registrations us either invalid significantly inaccurate  million dead people registered vote voting wonder happens  million people registered vote one state numbers folks numbers  noncitizens registered vote
liberals always object sort voter identification requirement say negatively affects minority voters may identification obvious nonsense real reason liberals oppose voter identification would make voter fraud difficult
by raising concerns voter fraud trump firing warning shot saying fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates preferred defeat calling cheating side simply putting democrats notice may cause cheat less would otherwise question whether trump able muster enough votes overcome amount cheating take place
the lgenpresse 
a second way system rigged legacy news media include three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc well newer ones cnn msnbc fox also includes remaining newspapers especially new york times washington post wall street journal ones reliably conservative fox wsj owned rupert murdock even accurate call fox wsj neoliberal rather conservative push globalist message open borders unenforced trade
trump media savvy hes public eye since philosophy publicity bad publicity trump used highlight policies making controversial statements able force media cover positions still nonstop smear campaign hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters still get news legacy sources
new media outlets like return kings breitbart danger  play favorable trump highly funded new media daily beast heat street buzzfeed huffington post push globalist message end result trump fighting ocean disinformation handful allies side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight best discourage trump voters
another way system rigged legacy media conspires discourage trump voters going polls one way poll democrats make look like trump losing example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher trump even obama able beat mccain  points even though packing stadiums  people hillary doesnt command sort adulation obama 
there huge motivation gap trump clinton recently trump held rally tampa  people showed people waited line  hours chance see trump day later hillary hosted rally florida  people showed likely paid plants running mate tim kaine even worse barely getting  people show one events
one day brexit vote polls showed remain leading  points leave ended winning  points
why legacy media report polls show trump losing landslide designed dishearten trump voters
conclusion trump able overcome rigged system heroic achievement one thing certain time give fight might elites want us discouraged give hope lie die one thing never even host hell rise oppose go ballot box november th regardless may hear otherwise life different president trump globalist pawn hillary

book job 
job devout believer god follows rules blessed incredible wealth numerous children satan challenges god arguing job faithful gained would immediately curse god everything taken away god allows satan destroy taking wealth killing children
once misfortune befalls job wife implores curse god job refuses instead openly laments god allowing suffer even asks god allow die
i would rather strangled
rather die suffer like this
i hate life dont want go living
oh leave alone remaining days job 
why make target
am burden you
why forgive sin
and take away guilt
for soon lie dust die
when look gone job 
what gain oppressing me
why reject work hands
while smiling schemes wicked job 
he series poetic dialogues priestly men attempt explain gods justice job asks pointed questions implying eager sin seem experience prosperity closely follow gods words
the godless seem like lush plant growing sunshine
its branches spreading across garden
its roots grow pile stones
it takes hold bed rocks
but uprooted
its though never existed job 
when plague sweeps through
he laughs death innocent
the whole earth hands wicked
and god blinds eyes judges
if hes one job 
just like many laws legal code always hook something illegal also many possible sins may impossible live clean life
whatever happens found guilty
so whats use trying
even wash soap
and clean hands lye
you would plunge muddy ditch
and filthy clothing would hate job 
the men job spills guts state hes sinning way knows nothing god works must grin bear instead questioning gods actions
pay attention job
stop consider wonderful miracles god
do know god controls storm
and causes lightning flash clouds
do understand moves clouds
with wonderful perfection skill
when sweltering clothes
and south wind dies everything still
he makes skies reflect heat like bronze mirror
can job 
god appears asks job dare question actions even though actions amounted agreement satan
who questions wisdom
with ignorant words
brace like man
because questions you
and must answer them
where laid foundations earth
tell know much
who determined dimensions
and stretched surveying line
what supports foundations
and laid cornerstone
as morning stars sang together
and angels shouted joy job 
god goes describe powers serves dare argument job accepts utter impotence
then lord said job
do still want argue almighty
you gods critic answers
then job replied lord
i nothinghow could ever find answers
i cover mouth hand
i said much already

you asked questions wisdom ignorance
it iand talking things knew nothing about
things far wonderful me
you said listen speak
i questions you
and must answer them
i heard before
but seen eyes
i take back everything said
and sit dust ashes show repentance job 
other parts bible channel job asking bad earth allowed continue
wake lord sleep
get reject us forever
why look way
why ignore suffering oppression
we collapse dust
lying face dirt
rise help us
ransom us unfailing love psalm 
and usual response question god
what sorrow awaits argue creator
does clay pot argue maker
does clay dispute one shapes saying
stop youre wrong
does pot exclaim
how clumsy be
how terrible would newborn baby said father
why born
or said mother
why make way isaiah 
after job stopped questioning god rewarded even greater prosperity before
so lord blessed job second half life even beginning  sheep  camels  teams oxen  female donkeys also gave job seven sons three daughters named first daughter jemimah second keziah third kerenhappuch land women lovely daughters job father put along brothers job lived  years living see four generations children grandchildren died old man lived long full life job 
you patient god
those plant tears harvest shouts joy weep go plant seed sing return harvest psalm 
the lesson story seems one stoicism accept fate dont question understand taken moments notice god wants matter cleanly lived honor ironically book make question gods wisdom other

what point accumulating wisdom life work hard
for much wisdom much grief increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes 
i thought wisdom better foolishness light better darkness wise see going fools walk dark yet saw wise foolish share fate die said since end fool whats value wisdom meaningless wise foolish die ecclesiastes 
so people get life hard work anxiety days labor filled pain grief even night minds cannot rest meaningless ecclesiastes 
all vanity

promiscuous bad women sent forth punishment god
i discovered seductive woman trap bitter death passion snare soft hands chains pleasing god escape sinners caught snare ecclesiastes 
solomon tries convince evil prosper cant help coming back fact does
when crime punished quickly people feel safe wrong even though person sins hundred times still lives long time know fear god better wicked prosper fear god days never grow long like evening shadows meaningless world life good people often treated though wicked wicked people often treated though good meaningless ecclesiastes 
at moment seems solomon goes rails seemingly promoting life debauchery
so recommend fun nothing better people world eat drink enjoy life way experience happiness along hard work god gives sun ecclesiastes 
one interpretation live sin like solomon eventually come conclusion life meaningless naught purpose fun book may included bible serve example happen behave solomon come end life thinking wasnt worth hope intended result otherwise would cause lose faith gods wisdom justice like job

over course years us presidential election nothing bizarre repeatedly speculated election may actually happen opportunely timed terrorist attack major event occurred right moment leading suspension november election theories appear credence sources within us intelligence contacted pat milton cbs news senior investigative producer warning terrorist attacks three us states highly likely come monday day us election us intelligence allegedly alerted joint terrorism task forces al qaeda isis could planning attacks new york texas virginia specific locations within three states mentioned 
us authorities said taking threat seriously though cbs news  sources stress threat still assessed credibility yet confirmed according cbs  counterterrorism officials alerted threat abundance caution 
earlier week also warnings polling places could seen attractive targets lone wolf attackers individuals motivated violent extremist ideologies sovereign citizen extremist activity led federal law enforcement plan several worstcase scenarios one fbi official told cbs  
the counterterrorism homeland security communities remain vigilant wellpostured defend attacks united states fbi working federal state local counterparts shares assesses intelligence daily basis continue work closely law enforcement intelligence community partners identify disrupt potential threat public safety 
however whats interesting terror threat coming al qaeda opposed islamic state syrian civil war us actively helping al qaeda grouping syrian branch  al nusra front  moderate rebels support therefore al qaedas ability launch attacks within us directly aided us intelligence making announcement incredibly suspect 
its also worth pointing al qaeda since inception product us intelligence community essentially created us fight soviets afghanistan ever since conveniently used justification expansion us wars abroad elimination civil liberties domestically 
it also interesting threat al qaeda islamic state islamic state terrorist bogeyman recent years involvement threat real imagined useful justification escalating us involvement syria seems highly likely islamic state left due recent revelations wikileaks showing funding comes entities donate millions clinton foundation 
it also worth noting terrorist attack come pass big help hillary hillary siege recent weeks due wikileaks near constant releases campaign chairs emails also due fbis mutiny led reopen probe clintons use private email server terror attack would give clinton opportunity gain political ground promoting aggressive foreign policy aims syria rest middle east 
however mentioned beginning article also possible terrorist attack us soil would give president obama authority either postpone outright cancel election something could normally except event extraordinary circumstances unfortunately time tell theory correct compelling us stay vigilant meantime

first must payment someone candidate electionrelated activity second campaign materially involved shaping communications third party group third electoral advocacy take place close election 
okeefe continues 
the payment prong test complicated fact foval paid employee americans united change duck events constitutes payment aufc conduct based admission campaign creamer agent aufc coordinated duck activities finally content donald ducks undeniably political content directed one candidate sole purpose helping another

in discussion okeefe described focusing bringing people one state another state vote illegally foval also worked deputy political director george sorosfunded people american way pfaw explains get away voter fraud 
instead bussing people better travel personal vehicles said 
would charge individual voter fraud going go facilitator conspiracy could prove one thing people drive personal cars theres bus involved changes dynamic 
its legality prove conspiracy theres bus said cars much harder prove  theres enough money people drive povs personally owned vehicles drive rentals 
foval says easy keep voter fraud operation secret use shells use shell companies

in world politics coverup often worse original crime role watergate coverup took richard nixon hillary clintons coverup email scandal could send prison long time news broke fbi renewed investigation hillary clintons emails  sent shockwaves throughout political world  time around arent talking investigation mishandling classified documents havent heard anyone talking fbi discovers hillary clinton altered destroyed concealed emails turned fbi original investigation could charged obstruction justice would immediately end political career found guilty could send prison rest life 
i seen single news report mention phrase obstruction justice yet convinced good chance scandal heading following relevant part federal statute deals obstruction justice  
whoever knowingly alters destroys mutilates conceals covers falsified makes false entry record document tangible object intent impede obstruct influence investigation proper administration matter within jurisdiction department agency united states case filed title  relation contemplation matter case shall fined title imprisoned  years 
if hillary clinton sent prison  years would essentially rest life 
i feeling fbi going find great deal evidence obstruction justice huma abedins emails unfortunately likely resolution matter november th according wall street journal approximately  emails search 
as federal agents prepare scour roughly  emails see many relate prior probe hillary clinton email use surprise disclosure investigators pursuing potential new evidence lays bare building tensions inside bureau justice department investigate democratic presidential nominee 
metadata found laptop used former rep anthony weiner estranged wife huma abedin close clinton aide suggests may thousands emails sent private server mrs clinton used secretary state according people familiar matter take weeks minimum determine whether messages workrelated time ms abedin served mrs clinton state department many duplicates emails already reviewed federal bureau investigation whether include either classified information important new evidence clinton email probe 
of  emails inside source told fox news  least   would interest investigation 
at point fbi officials even begun searching emails search warrant secured yet following comes cnn  
government lawyers havent yet approached abedins lawyers seek agreement conduct search sources earlier told cnn discussions begun law enforcement officials say 
either way government lawyers plan seek search warrant judge conduct search computer law enforcement officials said 
but fbi reportedly already searching laptop coowned anthony weiner huma abedin warrant necessary search weiner cooperating fbi 
many wondering fbi director james comey would choose make bold move week election day surely know would dramatic impact election unlikely would done unless someone already found something really big addition comey reportedly eager find opportunity redeem eyes peers fbi following excerpt daily mail article written ed klein author recently released new york times bestseller clintons entitled  guilty sin  
the atmosphere fbi toxic ever since jim announced last july wouldnt recommend indictment hillary said source close friend known comey nearly two decades shares family outings accompanies catholic mass every week 
some people including department heads stopped talking jim even ignored greetings passed hall said source felt betrayed brought disgrace bureau letting hillary slap wrist 
according source comey fretted problem months discussed great length wife patrice 
he told wife depressed stack resignation letters piling desk disaffected agents letters reminded every day morale fbi hit rock bottom 
so happens next 
in likely scenario fbi time complete investigation decide whether charge hillary clinton election means would go november th scandal hanging clinton campaign would seem good news donald trump 
however possible fbi starts searching emails could come conclusion rapidly charges clinton warranted happens could still see sort announcement election day 
in unlikely event happen could actually see hillary clinton forced race november th

if clinton forced step aside democrats would need come new nominee process would take time article later today important news reveal believe nominee would 
in scenario democrats would desperately need time get act together could actually see barack obama attempt delay suspend election  legality move highly questionable barack obama allowed little thing like us constitution stop past 
this week going exceedingly interesting  sure 
the craziest election modern american history keeps getting crazier feeling even twists turns ahead

my theory downing aircraft derived two reported wreckage sites lie weather given government loss three radio links time plane still  miles crash site signs plane sabotaged 
first claims made time newsweek ron browns plane crashed worst storm decade directly contradicted weather report issued dubrovnik airport tower adjacent crash site storm simply exist 
while plane carrying ron brown party still  miles crash site  mile air normal approach path three radio based links three separate propagation paths failed time 
according aviation week  space technology article dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact time aircraft vanished screens approach radar split awacs 
lets look split radar first 
the split radar watches approach dubrovnik airport ron brown aircraft dropped radar screen contrary silly claims made newsgroup plane flying mountains water open space around radar split routinely tracks aircraft airspace without problem normal split radar lose traffic point approach path nobody would mentioned would normal expected behavior nothing unusual comment made target dropping split radar establishes unusual event 
the split radar like atc radar tracks primarily aircraft transponder split radar lost track ron brown aircraft lost transponder return aircraft still approach path although starting veer slightly left 
now lets look awacs 
the awacs system designed track nontranspondered targets radar hits placed computer system keeps list tries match returns present radar sweep returns previous sweeps order generate meaningful target tracking data operators weapons management systems part process involves target target comparisons make certain computer thinks target xyz sweep target thought xyz last sweep total workload computer power function total number nontranspondered targets carried target list 
if target transponder awacs track target using transponder return less computer power needed transpondered target workload nontranspondered targets reduced 
how know awacs tracking ron brown plane via transponder awacs lost track time split radar lost transponder return awacs tracking ron brown plane via skinpaint reason lose track aircraft time split 
had awacs reported losing contact could surmise either awacs tracking skin paint split radar suffered momentary failure case 
it also true awacs could immediately reacquired ron brown aircraft skin paint known fact computers add nontranspondered target awacs watch bosnia dubrovnik airport 
the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together one common point single failure could make aircraft vanish split awacs radar transponder ron brown aircraft failure transponder explanation ron brown plane vanishing two different radar screens time still  miles crash site  mile adriatic sea 
at time aircraft vanished radars split awacs dubrovnik tower reported lost voice radio contact aircraft 
this third distinct propagation path awacs split fact direct line sight dubrovnik tower location approach path radio contact lost intervening geological features block radio signal dubrovnik tower continued communicate aircraft area radios tower fault 
the data reported aviation week  space technology article shows evidence two sperate systems board ron brown aircraft failed time cockpit radios radar transponder 
the radios radar transponders come together one common point single failure could make aircraft vanish split awacs lose voice radio contact dubrovnik tower electrical system failed mid air still  miles crash site  mile adriatic sea approach path know problem extended beyond electrical system 
simple prior loss radio flight crew acknowledged receiving weather report knew clear air beneath one reason flight crew suddenly without instruments descend cloud layer clear air knew thats event severed electrical cables also severed flight control cables occupy midline conduit  possible trigger 
given unscheduled nature trip timer would useless pinpoint exact geographic location detonation however knowing approach pattern airport location adriatic selected altitude aircraft along glide slope 
the simplest explanation fits twin wreckage sites early news reports water crash altitude triggered bomb placed aircraft prior departure aircraft climbs certain altitude device armed aircraft descends trigger altitude say  feet device detonates plane make shore 
as reports pointed weather ideal pilot even best navigation aids world would fully justified delaying descent order stay clear air long possible ducking quickly clouds find airfield 
this means altitude triggered bomb would detonated far closer land expected result portions wreckage came shore 
the  mile spread wreckage sites indicates airborne event blew part aircraft  mile distance coupled shallow impact angle suggests aircraft still flyable pilot may trying make airfield crash hill occurred thermite used 
its impossible state based information available public thermite definite possibility made using available materials show various detectors would sense chemical explosives c thermite ignited burns half temperature surface sun would burn aluminum aircraft ease packed suitcase near top baggage compartment converted  would ideal location sever control linkages short planes electrical system well burning hole skin dumping debris ocean bad weather

 one candidates trump denies existence global warming calls increasing use fossil fuels dismantling environmental regulations refuses assistance india developing nations called paris agreement combination could four years take us catastrophic tipping point trump also pledged deport  million mexican immigrants offered provide defense supporters assaulted african american protestors rallies stated openness using nuclear weapons supports ban muslims entering us regards police country absolutely mistreated misunderstood done unbelievable job keeping law order trump also pledged increase military spending cutting taxes rich hence shredding remains social welfare safety net despite pretenses
much trump stands anathema true need defend man however trump stakes important positions diametrical hillary clinton example clintons advocacy nofly zone syria saber rattling russia corporatefriendly policy toward socalled free trade deals
chomsky cleverly anticipated objection writing
 respect point  challenge citing claim clintons foreign policy could pose serious menace trump
in case conceding outside possibility trumps foreign policy preferable us already convinced need evidence aired discussion involving statement furthermore insofar fact matter following logic seems require vote trump though bit hard know whether making suggestion intending seriously
first chomsky concedes outside possibility trumps foreign policy preferable words chomsky posits inside possibility one assumes chomsky saying strongest likelihood clintons foreign policy preferable without substantiation would second raises unreasonable demand evidence trump follow less menacing foreign policy clinton given trump never held political office evidence exists exist plenty evidence clinton pursue menacing foreign policy reason assume clinton would reduce number american military bases overseas curtail military spending fact likelier would increase military spending also likeliest resort us military attack bring regime change syria pushing us closer military confrontation russia trumps detractors compare bombastic rhetoric unfavorably clintons rhetoric toward putin assad clintons undiplomatic utterances record
moreover following chomskys logic preferable policies trump lack evidence token objectionable policies trump also lack evidence reason trump political track record upon judge would oval office thus following chomskyian logic one could pass judgement hardly trumps pronouncements would really build wall mexicous border evidence would trump really ban muslims entering us evidence this
by effectively undermining trumps peacemongering visvis clintons warmongering chomsky logic undermines criticisms regressivist political utterances trump thus following chomskys logic seems bit hard know whether suggestion intended seriously
 suffering similarly extremist policies attitudes impose marginalized already oppressed populations high probability significantly greater result clinton presidency
one assumes chomsky refers domestic population trumps policies  true word protect jobs american workers punish offshoring american jobs along opposition tpp  would political reversal neoliberalization clintonomics would decidedly worse marginalized oppressed peoples home abroad economic plight students poor ill however would much better jill stein presidency 
the economic plight students poor ill would much better jill stein presidency
if chomsky referring preponderant violence us foreign policy oppressive genocidal populations agree basic moral principle must take responsibility actions consequences actions others far important consideration feeling good democratic administration hundreds thousands died millions people displaced terrorist organizations proliferated evidence clintons time political office thus vote clinton predictably vote lead continuation perhaps even ramping suffering others basic morality suggests writer steer clear casting oppressionenabling vote
 constitute sufficient basis voting clinton vote potentially consequentialnamely contested swing state
i contend chomskys basis  false questionable first chomsky staunchly argued concentrate foremost wrongful actions crimes state something influence seems chomsky believes trump supersede clintons record killing iraq libya syria clinton going close us military abroad trump called bases question one concentrates domestic population least rhetoric trump socalled free trade agreements offshoring us factories abroad bodes well american worker
 however left also recognize trump win based failure support clinton repeatedly face accusation based fact lacks concern sure victimized trump administration
this criticism antidemocratic furthermore criticism applies conversely chomskys citing accusation gives veneer credence effectively leads perpetuation businessparty duopoly records bill clinton barack obama administrations demonstrate futility proffered rationale clinton deregulated finance sector exposed american workers vagaries free trade implemented regressive welfare policies continued aggressive us militarism abroad obama bailing banks attempts cut back social security warring afghanistan libya yemen syria drone strikes confrontation russia china tpp lingering incarceration guantanamo bay important note democrats arguably freer hand implement rightist policy republicans since many supporters democrats mute opposition avoid providing succor republicans george bush stymied tinkering social security notably obama done aboutface social security proposed expansion picking popularity measure bernie saunders candidacy
 often charge emanate establishment operatives use bad faith justification defeating challenges corporate hegemony either democratic party outside ensure widely circulated mainstream media channels result many would otherwise sympathetic left challenge find convincing reason maintain ties political establishment rather breaking must

final comments
the tragedy opting lesser evilism people get evil
some leftist commentators argue evilism  found preposterous barack obama socalled lesser evil previous two election cycles obama lesser evilist man enables evil  cycles usbacked violence killing places gaza syria bahrain afghanistan yemen somalia underscore utter futility pandering perceived lesser evilism one votes degree evil one surprised evil results

chinas debt growth rate become focus discussions fair enough comparing outright levels may seem china collapse moment 
daniel fernandez suggested article  china reached debt limit  mises wire  response governments monetary expansion stimulus plan  financial crisis chinas corporate sector indeed leverage quickly followed equally fast pace leveraging household sector however order avoid comparing apples oranges need take closer look putting numbers perspective using data source used fernandez find chinas total debt percentage gdp  percent end  debttogdp ratio corporate government household sectors stood  percent  percent  percent respectively 
for government household sectors started considerably low levels last administration kicked fourtrillion yuan rmb stimulus plan  government debttogdp ratio kept mid first decade millennium stood  percent end  households debttogdp ratio  percent  almost doubled  percent  doubled  percent end  leveraging households happened exactly chinese society undergoing rapid urbanization well government launched  stimulus 
apart demand urban housing chinese households high savings rate extra cash hands invested real estate hedge future inflation furthermore stimulus package allowed easier lending household debt increased dramatically however must note although debt growth rate high absolute debt level household still considerably low versus global peers 
the disturbing trend found corporate sector debttogdp ratio increased approximately  percent prior   percent end  first level corporate debt mostly form bank loans high start means norm financial system dominated banking sector whose funding source mostly deposits two figures jonathan andersons think china series provide insights  
an international comparison assets banking system vs domestic saving rate 
breakdown assets chinas financial system 
this point demonstrated comparing financial asset structures example us china obviously bank loans dominant funding source corporate sector china whereas us role bank loans far prominent comparison enormous capital markets corporates raise equities bond financing easily 
financial asset structure us vs china  
data source world bank federal reserve bank shanghai stock exchange shenzhen stock exchange china central deposit clearing co ltd ccdc sifma 
it therefore surprising leveraging response governments stimulus plan manifested mostly credit extension banking system chinas flat yield curve 
the large role banks also seen chinas bond market yields one manifestation flat yield curve  reason simple deposits banks deposits manage lend invest deposits bond market usually long end boost yields investment strategy assetliability management scheme bids bond prices long end hence pushing longterm yields 
in addition allocating deposits two types assets bonds vs loans banks sometimes incentives invest bonds rather lending due balancing considerations corporate demand credit risks market liquidity yields also subject interest rate controls final stage liberalization lending rate completely liberalized early  yield spread current stage reflects combination chinas financial structure capital flows rather good indicator economic fundamentals government flooded market four trillion rmb stimulus plan  bond yields faced downward pressure longterm end please see yields chinese government treasury bonds maturity  years vs  year spread thereof figure wealth management products channel considerable amount deposits banking system capture higher yields outside bankingsector supervision form trusts example amount still pivotal enough change explained pattern fundamental manner 
data source wind ccdc 
china didnt open outside world late china provides half manufacturing goods close half electronic products world economy still growing around  percent obviously good part chinas production structure configured export mostly developed economies dominated service sector global demand developed economies lost momentum china faces necessity reconfiguring economic structure better serve domestic consumers stands  times number us consumers reconfiguration process surely painful demonstrated empty factories traditional export production oriented cities textbook case austrian economics work capital labor freed productions currently demanded market takes time moreover quick capital formation past three decades lifted labor productivity manufacturing sector needs upgraded tertiary sector needs expanded serve affluent society comparing  years ago chinese consumers dont go japan buy hitech toilet lids  healthier skepticism stimulus 
needless say current debt level causes concern deeper concern whether debt growth trajectory continue ultimately whether debt grow rate post  stimulus phase function fast chinese government runs money printing press recent article peoples daily  mouthpiece china communist party ccp  quoted diagnosis authoritative figure chinese economy cure authoritative figure suggested money printing stimulate economy chinese prepared lower growth rate comparing historical average  percent anyone understanding chinas political messaging system would mistake anything opinion handed top chinese leadership considered concluding remark policy swings past several years 
the xinhua news agency mainstream media group recently followed commentary suggesting resistance use stimulus plans face slowing growth xinhua also warned disastrous result advice followed messages like refreshing hear nowadays among mantra stimulus chorus around world chinas policy direction implemented remains seen least insidious effects stimulus well recognized top regime openly represented mainstream media addition series measures lower tax burdens corporate households alike also introduced central government pushing hard businessfriendly deregulations increasing economic freedom

1687,"wasnt long ago left represented antiestablishment wing politics used fight globalism remember antiglobalization movement even motives different todays antiglobalists well censorship imperialist wars expanding powers governments corporations today see leftists protesting brexit attacking censoring anyone disagrees establishment using twitter apple products sipping starbucks coffee calling war syria challenge russians hell end becoming patsies elites

to understand must go back  occupy movement ongoing occupy protests seem like ages ago came response economic downturn people realizing screwed system debate endlessly exactly people motives behind important fact elites sign people waking challenging power
the elites panic first time postwar history people west mobilized mass threaten rule cabals decided needed act fast whole movement evolved fullblown revolution already plan mind never antiquated strategy divide rule
the diversion 
when people discontent angry powerless dispossessed pressure mount wont go anywhere people want vent frustrations elites know responding directly repression inspires greater desire rise instead fighting prefer rechannel pent energy elsewhere
on february  occupy movement still raging elites given golden opportunityor rather created onewhen black teenager shot dead florida none infamous trayvon martin case shooter wasnt even full white elites jumped chance used control media throw everything anything divert public attention away efforts quickly became biggest story america
but didnt stop police shootings always happening races also highly publicized mainstream media stoke liberal outrage racial tensions led creation black lives matter movementa movement financed george soros others stir unrests across america
did elites convert occupy protesters sjw patsies
the diversion complete people interested racial issues  dictating lives occupy movement faded away people venting anger elsewhere although dont much proof rise blm movement strongly suspect resurgence social justice warriors around time also work elites want leftists target fellow citizens asinine cultural issues rather established order
the strategy 
back th century karl marx claimed religion nationalism used distract masses fact oppressed capitalism apply concept world today culture wars going distractions keep masses undermining power elites
the goal elites simple divide masses let fight never come together topple power meanwhile focus expanding wealth continue implement institutional control globalist plans worst case scenario elites want avoid common people unite one must everything fragment creating many divisions possible
my understanding modus operandi  use hotbutton issues stir controversy something doesnt affect like gay marriage race issues politically correct nonsense  leftists either get outraged something provoke reaction right  let people vent anger onto get others throats  issue fades away foment new controversy repeat whole process cycling elites able maintain status quo keep people uniting them
thus current situation masses divided blacks whites women men islam atheism christianity left right antiglobalization tea party movement occupy wall street
as long left continue berating right racists sexists bigots controlled corporations right turn accuse left degenerate socialist slackers want freebies nanny government nothing change long two sides see others enemies stupid ignorant getting way creating decent society people remain divided long rest population go berserk wedding cakes homosexuals latest misogynist outrage lion named cecil got shot elites continue win
a couple points consider know look like occupying army theres nothing alarmed theyre friendly neighborhood police jobs protect terrorists
first article focused left toyed globalist elites lets forget right totally immune influence either remember neocons  globalists puppets disguised conservatives  effectively lured conservatives america faith patriotism support got base impetus launch war iraq based bullshit evidences wmds saddamalqueda link right changed lot since still conservatives today itching war russia usa usa usa 
second crucial remember although main goal maintain divide rule end elites far sinister aims raising hell societies demographic conflicts terrorism elites preparing total social control get feeling elites letting chaos violence run course people two opposing camps join together approval new government measures social control
no matter differences people get terrified savagery disorder theyll welcome state intervene name security europe already getting used large military presence streets us government seemingly preparing war citizens  leaked soros memo also reveals blm movement potentially used federalize us police  many people seem concerned violence terrorism seems tools used elites justify totalitarian state near future
the culture wars necessary fight engineered distraction 
the issue culture wars easy one important many ways still forms distraction implemented elites
on one hand playing hands elites raging social justice feminist pigshits instead trying stop globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  governments undermining existence really issues politicallyincorrect halloween costumes whatever bathroom trannies use matter fact middleclass destroyed revelations massive corruption dnc coming policestate globalist wars causing death destruction around world drama outrage counteroutrage silly elites snickering new world order taking shape
on hand culture matter many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws censorship relevant issues much leftists serving pawns establishment situation isnt exactly divide rule model described way forced fight left everyone else getting way fighting globalist elites
so mean ally scorn us continue playing elites games bicker sjw drones dont good answer whatever choose believe crucial us focus battles get trolled petty issues mainstream media wants us focus always keep mind always top true enemies mankind
conclusion still hope 
although longer see grassroots movements popular mobilization current us election shown people still awake sick establishment alone hopeful sign people still willing challenge ruling class
with bernie sanders brought establishment supporters scattered different camps antiestablishment movement presidential campaign led donald trump seeing unprecedented efforts elites bring trump use disgruntled leftists supporters
i doubts trump  thousand times preferable certain nightmare hillary clinton bring america world gets elected besides voting believe important people wake aware methods control implemented upon us cant constantly expect knight shinning armor come rally us must take initiative willing fight destiny

1241,"eight ways strengthen democracy beyond voting strength civic life depends outside elections chuck collins   chuck collins 
throughout trying election season weve told much stake vote success democracy depends continuing pay attention long cast ballots 
so lets pledge strengthen democracy resolutions focus intentions keep us moving forward next four years 
 change media diet  
way much ink airtime mental real estate consumed horserace reporting electionsits whos winning losing unplug talk shows interview pollsters engage partisan bickering day find commentators independent media outlets strengthen civic life 
 turn corporate media 
this election profitable big media corporations bad democracy cbs chairman les moonves remarked  man would expected ride right moneys rolling fun 
our differences compounded media reports amplify loudest partisan utterances election coverage year encouraged us view one another cartoon caricatures neighbors 
 reject consumer mentality elections  
were encouraged view national elections like consumers buying car presidential elections make us feel like spectators participants election day small part real democracythink voting tiny fraction civic life 
 make voice heard  
pledge communicate elected officials year round want vote call write email attend community forums politician hears dozen constituents concern matters 
a resolutions must address polarized political atmosphere way break connecting people dont always agree 
for instance liberal california sociologist arlie hochschild spent five years interviewing conservative tea party activists louisiana making friends asking deep questions urges us scale empathy wall learn others stories 
heres easy ways get started 
try social media fast 
social media amazing mostly serves echo chamber reinforce existing views substitute talking people asking questions learning people support certain policies 
 practice art civil discourse  
find ways meet others facetoface engage conversations soapbox speeches debates look  living room conversation  movement brings people together across political divisions goal encourage authentic respectful conversations strengthen relationships advance understanding challenges opportunities solutions us 
finally resolutions focus changing polarizing election system 
 eliminate wealth primary  
long voters cast ballots primary big money donors winnowed field selected stand election people across political spectrum agree need fundamental campaign finance reform reduce influence big money including repeal citizens united  
 break twoparty duopoly  
a growing number voters declared independence two major parties allow voices perspectives excluded presidential debates democracy would benefit real choices outside two major parties countries world 
the strength civic life depends outside elections especially deeply toxic experience  need step protect real democracy profit division

first megyn kelly pulled sexist card undisclosed tax returns comments john mccain making fun crippled reporters reading mein kampf remarks dating daughter
then accusations racism former employees usage eminent domain hiring immigrants questionable practices trump university scandal blunder abortion old comments drug decriminalization gun control relationship clintons dc insiders comments refugees illegal immigrants khan incident course pussygrabbing scandal

surely time sink campaign wont  yet time teflon deflects dirt dexterously ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments nothing seems able stop opponents ever stop trying
trump fantastic ability escape unharmed would clearly destroy career politician howard deans yeehaw enough end bid democratic candidate  yet trump call end muslim refugees accused grabbing women loins end praised masses mainstream media spew bile 

what allowed trump maneuver nimbly accusations unprecedented role internet media elections including able reach people directly twitter lack trust traditional media well biggerthanlife persona letting get away others would lynched for
but thats story another article would rather talk something else particularly anything could stop answer surprise goes conventional wisdom
yes think
trumps weak spot 
one biggest problems defeating trump unlike politicians political scandals seem affect even aid saying every antitrump meme also protrump meme

trump mastered political antifragility causes strengthen opponents try destroy trump defeated lefts platform fascists mentality saying things outrageous option report him
so left cannot choose cover let wallow obscurity like ron paul neither attack attacks make popular

one memorable movie quote remember went something like every man weak spot first try buy money women go family doesnt work well bullet always job unfortunately unlike political losers need peoples money lack female attention family smart probably safe violence
but isnt article god forbid donald trump getting assassinated would stop trump trump train trump man trump idea avatar discontent opposed progressive ideology would become martyr thus raising hatred opponents fever pitch might alter americas consciousness forever trumps enemies cant afford that
so ignoring trump work throwing dirt work bribing doesnt work even killing wont work left answer might surprise you
you see trumps power comes contrarianism candidate anticandidate people dont vote trump vote hillary obama progressives cuckservatives wrecking ball injured working class nonliberal whites well minorities completely love progressive marxist ideology want use establishment
so done stop  
well lets ask makes trump popular  brashness antipc attitudes antielitism part establishment hacks one different
so gives trump strength would make sense weaken would present opposite present nothing special make look boring weak present another pcdrone
theyve claimed nonstop trump next hitler start building concentration camps sexually assaulting random women grabbing cock pockets obliterate muslims minorities right wing death squad robots

instead could claimed weakling trying act tough wont deliver anything love political correctness respects women progressives best choice bring four years obama
that course would present difficulties age online media monopoly physical press broken news circulates speed minutes rather hours days would hard establishment media accomplish hard call trump ordinary boring statements break many taboos
yet difficult may least would chance success small calling sexist racist mean words nothing stop instead made popular masses incidents made donald seem human made people trust showing flaws opposite effect intended hated already needed extra ammo liked either left indifferent whats worse excited statements

at worst moderates doubts set mind however considering short attention span undecided voters stellar performance second debate clearly made forget statement maybe even convinced focus bills sexual misdeeds instead
why havent opponents used 
this brings us final point article havent opponents used brains figure hard believe considering amount money poured think tanks
no truth like strategy forsaken sideeffects would camp opponents try attack another pc drone would also attacking like hillary trying paint trump sex offender made easier trump point bills sexual indiscretions said mighty book kek  thee dwell glass lodgings shall propel sedimentary formations prophecy kek chapter   verse  

attacking trump multicultural politically correct weak inefficient shill would shed light establishments weakness

like many others bought fallacy need piece paper university succeed life age thirty graduated university undergraduate degree customary debt came along twentynine years later see wrong was
soon graduating obtained office job moved city knew one job optimistic turned like marriage crack whore day walking minefield full dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights every problem associated modern workplaces worse yet cut male managers allowed trim charge resulting fucked toxic culture three tumultuous abusive years found unceremoniously kicked curb surprisingly relieved
after lengthy stint unemployment landed entrylevel job metal fabrication company one benefits offered tuition reimbursement work related classes enrolled welding classes night upgraded skills employers dime
i immediately noticed difference previous job worked exclusively men except token assholes men liked solitude jobs left alone work varied creative overtime pay decent fact work ethic showed every day time desired learn earned respect quickly
i eventually went different path returned welding parttime adjunct instructor
welding joining two metal pieces parts applying heat filler metal electrode helps make joint power source supplies electricity required heat shielding gas fluxcovered electrode aids welding process
the common welding processes gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw shielded metal arc welding smaw gas metal arc welding easiest learn offers fastest production welding involves ferrous steel nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according bureau labor report need welders grow  percent 
 according national association manufacturers report nearly  percent manufacturers united states report cannot find skilled welders meet demand
 american welding society reports average age welder midfifties
 entrylevel wages region average  annually skilled welders earning  five years trade
i frequently hear employers desperate skilled welders one plant manager told many computer jockeys enough people weld turn wrench another manufacturer told dozen welders retiring one replace school teach jobs available students enrolled
what welders welders work manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts fiveday week overtime common welders often perform duties like operating metal fabrication equipment assembly work
the skills welder develops value earning potential example able weld cut fit metals read weld symbols prints command higher wage becoming certified certain weld procedures also increases welders wages marketability
qualifications 
welding quintessential bluecollar job physically demanding hot dirty requires high degree skill personal characteristics good eyesight hand eye coordination good manual dexterity good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training entrylevel jobs welding programs nine months school also offers sixteenweek work ready certificate welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes blueprint reading unlike typical ivory palace college professors instructors required minimum three years related verifiable industrial experience job placement also good
additional facts 
despite decent paying skill high demand clueless parents educators continue dissuade young men entering bluecollar trades like welding result entire generation young men ruined hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees insurmountable debt
perhaps perceptive bright young rok reader considering career change closing consider facts
 always employment welder
 welding skills highly transferable carry skills next often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs today average welders wages increase skill overtime merit increases production bonuses common benefits welders
 end shift leave job door
 welding offers level creativity solitude seeing fruits labor studies show welders machinists bluecollar trades lower suicide rates many whitecollar professions
 welding often gateway trade even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance millwright
 welding male dominated occupation traditionalist men find offers insulation respite typical feminist diatribe pc bullshit todays corporate world
conclusion welding benefited first developed reasoning skills something academia failed also developed thorough understanding men dirty nasty dangerous jobs life feminists elitists marginalize men want men risk lives health build maintain shit

1675,"last week expounded idea take time ponder emotions  matter much prompting us take action think something sustained emotional states lead us pedestalize girls ignore needs refraining caring interests whereas others push every day also allow said girls go shamelessly shortterm pleasure complacent rapefugees shrieking fingerwaving men kin
pondering passions emotions mean getting led expense critical thinking rather exact opposite allows us spot shrewd ones want push emotional buttons well freer take thoughtful actually less emotiondetermined actions gained awareness passions decide ones want stimulate why
following idea made suggestions could stir positive emotions empathy hope love today four passions emotions admiration shame humility fear
 admiration 
society think admit victimhood raised weaklings acted cluelessly good intentions women particular empathetic nurturing towards nice beta malesas long empathy extent admitted boundarieshence taking opposite direction egotistical uncaring orientation lot currently harbor course equate validating much unhealthy unmanly men women also trained validating manlier men admiration comes play
as nassim taleb put living extremistan highest level take lions share resources diminish quickly ladder girls today tend admire famous highstatus people leads despise ninetynine per cent exasperated hypergamy tamed average man long achieves minimum andor upstanding dutiful gets fair share democratic still conditional distribution girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour men decrease intramasculine competition 
girls also admireand mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care ought least esteemed average girl
 shame 
shame arises measuring actions moral standards discovering fall short actions fall short fail notice shamed made notice shame normally accentuated object exposed unlike embarrassment also attaches thought action remains undisclosed undiscoverable others neel burton heaven hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes blow makes one lose face composure eventually feel guilt remorse like strong emotions used consumed malignancy left
leftists created narrative whites held entirely responsible dreadful historical phenomena slavery holocaust oppression minority groups racism phenomena constantly talked expanded whites also supposed feel correspondingly boundless guilt sheer power guilt explain many whites afraid stand shamed racist nazi enough endure rejection ones family lose reputation employment
shame aroused two levers standards one agrees ones purported responsibility levers skillfully used un shame liberalfavored groups standards feminists attacked called slutshaming also shaming relentlessly manly behavior responsibility pretty much claim identify minority tend deny slipping majoritys shoulders
this get persistent offenders jihadi families expressing neither shame remorse whereas productive working normally sociable person gets nagged white current year better true rapist evade responsibility shame invading europe young virgin european descent
what sounds pretty obvious theory though much harder carry practice people evidently hate shamed especially accustomed blaming everything others
shame fatties  shame arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness respect obvious recall selfdetermination antiwhite liberals criminals made free choices carry associated responsibility
as us must keep face straight never make clueless concessions skillful framers hysterical sjws appeal moral standards put forth legitimate appeal purported actions responsibility emphasize theirsand cannot boiled external factors
even dogs cats considered responsible caretakers punished bad behaviours learn likewise granting certain people groups constant deresponsabilization amounts give free pass destroying everything criminals said groups agency liberals gave pass plunder kill whitey responsible well
shame also arise associated something someone deemed despicable liberal policy distinguishing sharply terrorists documented aliens spite much latter house former allows latter going without shame even closely associated terroristswhereas every white threatened shame ist phobic acquaintance
turn table shake burden disenfranchised majority put back acting impunity long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego enough notwithstanding economic racial factors explain host social problems blinded girls ignore much determined cravings shortterm desires latest fashions around drink loads booze fuck random strangers reframe story rape later blame guy  never learn cook clean take care something else instagram account corporate career speaking corporate isnt striking many men badly need employment sex almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe havetakeit all
ego makes one lose sense proportion balance leads complacency merciless exploitation others refusal take responsibility open despise
augustine hippo wrote humility foundation virtues makes sense ones ego inflated one feel need practice virtues feels entitled never ashamed shortcomingsthat easily denied blamed someone else ego also leads wasting resources luxury parce que je le vaux bien  says famous brand cosmetics instead focusing selfimprovement caretaking
though girls first ego smashed survival basic family units depends bloated ego general disease age men sold idea say smug urban elf proof one sides progress civilization whereas actually weak dependent unable fix anything individual selves
 fear 
readers asked fear powerful emotion point prompting one freeze flee abandon previously planned course action never even think consider idea action left using two different albeit complementary ways
first constantly accused conservatives play fears implying irrational unjustified fears dared ask serious questions making realistic assessment  immigration act voted democrat senators pretended opening borders would change ethnic mix america suspicion might happen highly emotional france socialists mainstream righters alike carrying accusations left accused doubt hint unjustified intolerable fear
well happened since doesnt look like every fear right justifiedespecially since postww right always incredibly wary say coward came criticize lefts moral high ground
second left also keen exactly accused conservatives namely stirring fear political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture patriarchal oppression men actually became weaker associated nazism white person assumes race basically survive shamelessly bludgeoned could call white supremacists defending ones right live peace hordes thugs violent parasites equal hitler himself
whites led fear supposed authoritarian tendencies shrewd jews intrigued frankfurt school put see kevin macdonald culture critique  chap whites led fear fearsbetter ones daughter killed muslims expressing concerns whites racism evil boo
when younger noticed local thugs huge advantage us normal people much fearless devilmaycare provocative attitude made potentially dangerous bourgeois prude beta male attractive females incidentally first movie french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions womanizer shows young arab decent pickup experience taking young middleclass white boy wing help escape virginity
feeling fear necessary step life fear appears greatly useful something flee watch potential hazard fearful afraid wrong things serious liability never trust liberal either points finger fearful tries paint dangerous justifying fearmongering
on flip side feared others always negative people need afraid respect try treat correctly let free rein innate generosity harm exploit people everyone around may tempted disrespect kept check minimal fear better feared respected getting tread upon
conclusion frame un frame whatever matters left cursed us locking us always negative framing fail whatever reason despised weak losers succeed say privileged oppressive cases chosen framing leads negative emotions associated us matter actually 
fortunately always possible turn tables provided keep tight frame change emotions well example weak elicit empathy noticed good intentions noble infirmities strong elicit admiration trust

call crisis whiteness 
white anxiety fueled years political tumult west britains surprising vote exit european union donald j trumps unexpected capture republican presidential nomination united states rise rightwing nationalism norway hungary austria greece 
whiteness context skin color could define membership ethnonational majority thats mouthful really means privilege defined 
whiteness means part group whose appearance traditions religion even food default norm person unspoken rules long entitled part us instead 
snip 
its fundamentally said eric kaufmann professor politics birkbeck college university london mean part nation nation anymore meaning ethnic majority 
these kinds questions really front center even though theyre necessarily verbalized 
the questions seem like sudden reversal decades rising multiculturalism civil rights movement united states european unions opening borders 
snip 
white peoples officially privileged status waned latter half th century demise discriminatory practices say university admissions rising wages expanding social safety net new educational opportunities helped offset white adults wealthier successful parents confident children would better still 
that feeling success may provided sort identity 
but western manufacturing industry declined taking many workingclass towns parents grandparents found opportunities unavailable next generation 
that creates identity vacuum filled 
for someone lower income lower class professor kaufmann explained youre going get selfesteem communal identity ethnicity nation would sort achieved identity

snip 
the formal rejection racial discrimination societies extension constructed new broader national identity united states black president london muslim mayor pakistani descent 
but broadening feel like painful loss articulated demand voiced trump rallies probrexit events gatherings populist parties throughout europe want country back 
the mantra bigotry rather part culture designed around peoples community customs constant background hum reassurance belonging 
the loss comforting hum accelerated phenomenon robin diangelo lecturer author calls white fragilitythe stress white people feel confront knowledge neither special default whiteness race like 
fragility leads feelings insecurity defensiveness even threat trigger backlash perceived outsiders 
snip 
for decades language white identity existed context white supremacy became taboo left white identity politics without vocabulary 
if workingclass white person fear new cosmopolitan world destroy diminish identity cherish culturally acceptable way articulate perceive crisis 
some people instead reached issues feel close concerns trade crime war drugs controlling borders fear islamist terrorism significant right create real fears many people also become means public conversation societys changes mean white majorities

there likely return whiteness social dominance exclusive national identity immigration cannot halted without damaging western nations economies immigrants already arrived cannot expelled en masse without causing social moral damage groups seem cutting line fact getting chance progress long denied 
western whites place within nations new broader national identities unless accept crisis whiteness seems likely continue"
1728,"things learned united states election well need keep mind make efforts return sanity society
the federal government corrupted probably shocking lesson election entire federal government coopted serve single partythe democrats best example behavior fbi director james comey fbi part executive branch government comey reports loretta lynch turn reports obama despite fact one expects fbi allowed high degree discretion honestly investigate individuals regardless political party belong us founded upon idea equal law
comeys actions reveal fbi thrown equality law window first fbi investigated clintons use unsecure personal email server conduct national business secretary state even though clinton apparently violated several laws gotten people severe jail sentences comey exonerated back july hand slap
in move surprised everyone comey reopened october th criminal investigation clinton  emails state department emails found pervert anthony weiners computer trump supporters rejoiced hillary supporters expressed outrage white house calmly called comey man integrity know something didnt
it turns fix beginning  hours election day comey exonerated clinton  fbi director likely intended clear clinton wrongdoing election defuse donald trumps criticism her
the big lesson law applied selectively wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need play rules everyone else unless situation corrected means rule law deadand grave lesson indeed
the elites control elites want believe super smart super powerful like great oz
ive written many times control globalist elites exert country control media educational institutions politicians form bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees controlling flow information setting narrative globalists able control masses like cattle good news control complete omnipotent
the weakness elites demonstrated three ways first brexit vote prime minister david cameron agreed hold referendum uks membership eu never dreamed britons would actually vote leave polls time showed movement leave would go flames still work men like nigel farage boris johnson british populace voted leave eu brits leave side endure called racist look past polling said chance win
the second way campaign trump gop planned coronation jeb bush rest gop field candidates virtually indistinguishable jeb trump came uncompromising message crushed jeb rest little jebs elite plan hillary versus weak conservative completely thrown disarray trumps campaign even trump lost general still victory instead seeing great oz see globalists behind curtain
the third manifestation weakness elites rise alt right tiny group young people internet able quickly wake large segments population year ago terms like nationalism globalism rarely heard us grandmothers texas tweeting need lay axe globalists
the overall lesson fear globalist elite exist able fool majority population us sound strategy defeated
the elite completely divorced nonelites 
in past europe aristocracy aristocracy close relationship rest people country aristocracy expected defend nation case war also religion rest country already knew modern aristocracy globalist elites responsibilities toward rest us thanks wikileaks learned dont even share religion
wikileaks revealed hillary clinton campaign manager close friends marina abramovic serbian artist performs occult rituals calls  spirit cooking  spirit cooking appears set magical rituals use bodily fluids menstrual blood urine semen achieve certain goals usually sexrelated also involves least minor sacrifices one recipe calls cutting ones figure eating pain
while spirit cooking certainly grotesque intention focus except point become sort initiation ritual us globalist elite hillary clinton john podesta jayz beyonce lady gaga gwen stefani attended rituals would surprised learn many politicians ceos bankers also participate getting invited one spirit cooking sessions means gained entry wealthy elite us probably similar groups rituals modern day european elites
there several things work spirit cooking participants probably dont believe efficacy spirit cooking ritual like college fraternity initiation means something terms ones social standing also satanic imagery spirit cooking sexual overtones big middle fingers christianity elite regard religion unwashed masses
in ways modern elite separated rest us dont share destiny us country starts going hell wealthy elite pick move another country live small heavily guarded compounds untouched damage policies caused even lack common morality us eyes wealth somehow put beyond traditional moral code guides rest us
the fact elites regard rest country bode well aristocracy old knew fortune bound countrymen modern elite lack wisdom enough hoi polloi realize matter time pseudoelites deposed pedestal
conclusion trumps election problem federal government used political purposes mitigated however problems indulgent pseudoelite continue force prevents patriarchy returning case grateful election  exposed cancers eating away society

queen elizabeth ii like 
did know immune prosecution personal poet paid sherry wine holds dominion british swans fire entire australian government 
its true role british head state largely ceremonial monarch longer holds serious power day day historic prerogative powers sovereign devolved largely government ministers still means british government declares war regulates civil service signs treaty authority 
and still wields prerogative powers  well numerous unique powers ranging surprising utterly bizarre 
most famously owns swans river thames 
technically unmarked swans open water belong queen though crown exercises ownership certain stretches thames surrounding tributaries according official website royal family 
today tradition observed annual swan upping swans river thames caught ringed set free part census swan population 
its highly ceremonial affair taking place five days swan uppers wear traditional uniforms row upriver six skiffs accompanied queens swan marker 
the swans also given health check ringed individual identification numbers queens swan warden professor ornithology university oxfords department zoology according royal family website 
rule britannia britannia rules waves goes classic british song  rule extends beneath waves sovereign dominion variety aquatic animals british waters 
the queen still technically owns sturgeons whales dolphins waters around england wales rule dates back statute  reign king edward ii according time 
according article statute still valid today sturgeons porpoises whales dolphins recognised fishes royal captured within  miles  km uk shores wash ashore may claimed behalf crown generally brought port sturgeon sold usual way purchaser gesture loyalty requests honour accepted elizabeth 
the law still observed  welsh fisherman investigated police catching foot sturgeon bbc reported time scottish government also issued guidance law  writing right claim royal fish scotland allows scottish government behalf crown claim stranded whales large drawn land wain pulled six oxen 
the queen drive without licence 
driving licenses issued queens name yet person united kingdom doesnt legally need license drive number plate cars according time 
despite required license queen comfortable behind wheel learned drive world war ii operated firstaid truck womens auxillary territorial service result queens training also change spark plug time notes 
queen elizabeth ii isnt afraid show driving skills either  surprised king abdullah saudi arabia still prince driving around country seat balmoral 
former british ambassador sherard cowpercoles recounted meeting sunday times instructed crown prince climbed front seat front land rover interpreter seat behind surprise queen climbed driving seat turned ignition drove women  yet  allowed drive saudi arabia abdullah used driven woman let alone queen 
cowpercoles continued nervousness increased queen army driver wartime accelerated land rover along narrow scottish estate roads talking time interpreter crown prince implored queen slow concentrate road ahead 
unlike members royal family queen require passport issued name despite lack travel documents abroad many times 
she two birthdays 
when youre british head state one birthday isnt enough queens official birthday celebrated saturday june though actual birthday april  
official celebrations mark sovereigns birthday often held day actual birthday particularly actual birthday summer according royal mint 
both birthdays celebrated suitable style actual birthday marked publicly gun salutes central london midday according official website british monarchy includes gun salute hyde park gun salute windsor great park gun salute tower london  majesty celebrated th birthday  walkabout streets outside windsor castle meet wellwishers 
for official birthday celebrations meanwhile joined members royal family spectacular trooping colour parade moves buckingham palace mall horseguards parade 
she private cash machine 
less power perk job private cash machine use royal family installed basement buckingham palace provided coutts one britains prestigious  exclusive  banks 
the queen personal poet 
the poet laureate honorary position british society appointed monarch poet whose work national significance according official website british monarchy first role introduced appointee paid  per year plus butt canary wine today poet laureate given barrel sherry 
carol ann duffy hold position  
she sign laws 
the queens consent necessary turn bill actual law proposed law passed houses parliament makes way palace approval called royal assent recent british monarch refuse provide royal assent queen anne back  
royal assent different queens consent queen must consent law debated parliament affects monarchys interests reforming prerogative tax laws might affect duchy cornwall example without consent bill cannot debated parliament 
queens consent exercised advice ministers existence provides government tool blocking debate certain subjects bills tabled backbench rebels opposition 
it exercised least  times according documents released freedom information act including one instance queen completely vetoed military actions iraq bill  private members bill sought transfer power authorise military strikes iraq monarch parliament guardian reported  
she create lords 
the queen power appoint lords sit parliament upper house britains legislative system like many powers exercised advice elected government ministers 
she doesnt pay tax anyway 
the queen pay tax voluntarily paying income tax capital gains tax since  
the queen power form governments 
unlike queen prime minister david cameron doesnt literally sit throne rob stothardgetty imageshbobi 
the queen previously wielded power dissolve parliament call general election fixedterm parliaments act put end  twothirds vote commons required dissolve parliament fiveyear fixedterm 
she still play part election however calls mp able form government 
this caused worry ahead years general election looked conservatives might majority would largest party would try form government meanwhile feasible labour could form majority despite fewer seats entering coalition multiple parties 
in situation queen would stuck rock hard place every year opens parliament queens speech lays governments plans give david camerons speech would arguably tacitly endorse government  staying away would send opposite message 
at one point times told sources planned stay away cameron failed secure enough mps palace later aboutface royal sources confirmed would lead proceedings even risk speech would overthrown following week tories failed muster enough backing smaller parties times subsequently reported 
she knights 
sure longer ride around horseback wooing maidens tales valour britain still retains knights like lords appointed queen  knights personally 
knighthoods typically given figures made particular contribution british society  whether business arts military elsewhere terry pratchett knighted legendary fantasy author forged special sword using pieces meteorite 
the individuals knighted decided ministers bbc reports present list nominees year approval 
she exempt freedom information requests 
all information royal family exempt freedom information requests exemption made legal battle guardian government letters prince charles sent whitehall ministers made public socalled black spider memos recently released change means cant happen future 
she ignore overrule ministerial advice grave constitutional crisis 
while overwhelming majority queens prerogative powers devolved ministers one exception allows wield power grave constitutional crisis sovereign act contrary without ministerial advice precedent modern times clear would actually constitute possibility remains 
the queen holds ability fire entire australian government 
as head state australia queen certain powers government  example queens representative country time gov gen sir john kerr fired prime minister response government shutdown 
kerr appointed replacement immediately passed spending bill fund government max fisher wrote washington post three hours later kerr dismissed rest parliament australia held elections restart scratch havent another shutdown since 
in addition uk australia queen also head state antigua barbuda bahamas barbados belize canada grenada jamaica new zealand papua new guinea saint kitts nevis saint lucia saint vincent grenadines solomon islands tuvalu 
all commonwealth realms former british colonies british sovereign retains position holds united kingdom head state britain largely ceremonial role day day 
shes head religion 
queen elizabeth ii head church england britains state religion first established king henry viii split away catholic church rome th century 
her formal title defender faith supreme governor church england also power appoint bishops archbishops many powers however exercised advice prime minister takes advice church commission 
an interesting side effect sovereign must confirmed member church england catholics religions may ascend british throne prince charles converted islam example would unable become king queen elizabeth ii dies 
she gets give away special money elderly 
maundy money special kind silver coin queen gives away pensioners every year uk cathedral every easter special ceremony number recipients corresponds sovereigns age year example  easter rolls around give maundy money away  pensioners 
the coins technically legal tender despite coming unconventional pence pence denominations given coins rare status tend enter general circulation 
shes also immune prosecution 
all prosecutions carried name sovereign immune prosecution cannot compelled give evidence court 
in theory sovereign incapable thinking wrong legal scholar john kirkhope told business insider however barrister baroness helena kennedy qc told bbc  nowadays immunity questionable 
although civil criminal proceedings cannot taken sovereign person uk law queen careful ensure activities personal capacity carried strict accordance law according official site monarchy 
if monarch commit grievance offence would almost certainly forced abdicate least one precedent courts prosecuting sovereign th century king charles tried treason following english civil war said earthly power justly call king question delinquent court disagreed executed 
the queen right consulted encourage warn ministers 
assuming grave constitutional crisis queens input legislative process supposed limited real terms right consulted encourage warn ministers  advice delivered via meetings prime minister 
the queen also certain historic rights privileges john kirkhope lawyer successfully campaigned details queens consent made public provided business insider list stranger rights queen still holds

why bill clintons  trips lolita express child rape jet matter may    
daniel greenfield   
we dont know bill clinton didnt company jeffrey epstein certainly know epstein almost outrageously got away  

some shocking allegations epstein surfaced conclusion fbi probe civil suits brought victims example claim three yearold french girls delivered birthday present feds identify roughly  young women underage time described lured epsteins palm beach home pretense giving massage money pressured various sex acts well balkan sex slave epstein allegedly boasted purchasing family  recently big cash payment mail sunday coaxed one epsteins main accusers anonymity describe claims years teenage sex toy victim virginia roberts produced photo prince andrew  reported epstein paid  meet prince  years old claims abused epstein loaned friends age  

sex crimes kind roberts alleges took place typically carry term   years federal prison yet said done epstein served scant yearplusonemonth private wing palm beach jail granted hourperday free pass leave premises work 

in short epstein never actually jail house arrest flew around country jets new york city place private island least one epsteins victims claimed met bill clinton turns bill clinton much regular passenger lolita express 

former president bill clinton much frequent flyer registered sex offenders infamous jet previously reported flight logs showing former president taking least  trips aboard lolita express  even apparently ditching secret service detail least five flights according records obtained foxnewscom 

clintons presence aboard jeffrey epsteins boeing   occasions reported flight logs show number double trips   included extended junkets around world epstein fellow passengers identified manifests initials first names including tatiana trickedout jet earned nabakovinspired nickname reportedly outfitted bed passengers group sex young girls 

it doesnt help democratic establishment seems played role getting epstein pass child rape bill clinton already rape accusations past clintons become notorious willingness favors criminals exchange money 

either way weve come long way gary hart bounced monkey business bill clinton flying around child rapists plane without anyone media seeming care much 

social conservatives often get bad rap really limit low standards fall trace moral code vanishes window bill clinton actually knows importantly days cares

donald trump president yet barack obama could still extraordinary amount damage last two months white house prior election described period time ending january th danger zone outlook changed donald trump victorious election night see next two months absolutely critical time get january th without something major happening perhaps breathe little bit easier least hand events next two months could easily plunge country period unprecedented chaos lot people feeling really good things right trumps victory definitely time relax let guard 
and truth donald trump even presidency yet detailed shortly election night  next president determined december th electoral college meets 
on monday december th members electoral college gather  state capitals cast votes president next president united states elected 
throughout history electors followed people  perfect time faithless electors democrats get enough switch sides december still possible though probable hillary clinton could win election 
one petition asking electors switch votes already signed  million people petition claims donald trump unfit serve president since hillary clinton popular vote wide margin elected president instead following comes usa today article entitled  could electoral college elect hillary clinton instead donald trump  
a changeorg petition signed  million people encourages members electoral college cast votes hillary clinton college meets dec  petition argues donald trump unfit serve secretary clinton popular vote president 
if vote way states voted donald trump win petition states however vote hillary clinton choose even states allowed vote would still counted would simply pay small fine  sure clinton supporters glad pay calling electors ignore states votes cast ballots secretary clinton 
personally dont believe going happen may able flip electors gap electoral votes almost certainly wide democrats overcome 
however concern facing ever since victory november th multitude violent threats donald trump family without doubt lot powerful people would interested finding way keep donald trump getting inauguration day let us pray safety safety family 
if donald trump incapacitated wins electoral college vote december th mike pence would take place 
but something happen december th electors would free vote another candidate  including hillary clinton 
if everything goes smoothly donald trump successfully makes inauguration day could facing one biggest political protests united states history 
in article important news  showed far left calling thousands upon thousands protesters descend upon washington dc january th order disrupt inauguration festivities much possible 
this giant protest organized usual suspects already put facebook pages  websites  hashtag disruptj widely used social media 
traditionally inauguration day day joy celebration far left seems intent transforming massive riot 
let us hope successful 
another reason danger zone next two months barack obama may choose united nations 
now looks like donald trump going next president international pressure barack obama something united nations regarding israelipalestinian conflict end term become even intense 
and something trump advisers actively concerned fact came across article earlier today discussed fact trump team warning obama making moves israelipalestinian conflict last months office  
saying pushing agendas contrary presidentelects position would spirit transition trump national security advisor donald trump last week warned obama administration making moves israelipalestinian conflict last months office 
on big transformative issues president obama presidentelect trump alignment dont think keeping spirit transitionto try push agenda items contrary presidentelects positions advisor told politico  
specifically concern obama may decide support un security council resolution would officially recognize palestinian state set parameters two state solution establish east jerusalem capital new palestinian state 
just weeks ago article wall street journal entitled  obamas israel surprise  reported one options obama administration strongly considering right un security council resolution would legally binding israel palestinians would something president trump would able undo 
the rest un security council eager support resolution decision whether resolution going happen sits hands barack obama moment know going following comes article leo hohmann  
the wall street journal reported one week tuesdays election obama requested aides provide list options deal decadesold israelipalestinian conflict 
israeli diplomats according wsj story preparing possibility lameduck president obama may try force diplomatic resolution israel palestinians united nations 
the president presumably reviewing options number half dozen 
he may preparing recognize palestinian state un leaves office  wsj reported 
if barack obama decides divide land israel united nations worst decision entire presidency warned repeatedly hell break loose america happens also mean many events warn latest book much closer many anticipating 
but get january th land israel divided yet may able rest easy least little trump already said would support un security council resolution forces solution israelis palestinians 
when politicians going something know people wont like tend try sneak around holidays lot people arent paying attention example yesterday discussed legislation created federal reserve rushed congress right christmas

in introduction triumphal encomium ideological victory alt right embodied election donald trump spencer makes one interesting remark 
but even though always took trump seriously still moment unreality  perhaps painfully intense reality  state pennsylvania called donald trump moment knew kek smiled upon us meme magic real though terms used halfjokingly represent something truly importantthe victory  willed donald trump office made dream reality  
it delivered manner injoke taken seriously moreover uninitiated mysteries internet movement probably unclear kek exactly meme magic 
well start explanation lesser weirdness 
meme expression denoting inexistent existent coined apparently richard dawkins explain human thoughts fit evolutionary theology memes thoughts expressed image andor phrase circulation public acquire life subsistence able infect consciousness messages like viruses meme inexistent theres thing thoughts biologically based selfsubsistence ability procreate like viruses images andor phrases living beings save bad analogy omits tell us exactly based one principle making memes viruses congenial yet quite paradoxically exist analogy apparently works  however one seems pose question works 
well works magical 

chaos magick 

here example magical thinking postmodern  fact posthumanist  vein resting assumption evolved nature   created analogy imagined process evolution artificial construct line principle evolution real precise accordance imaginary nature principle imagined existence  
therefore meme magick works insofar relies upon artificial preferably technological medium sustenance assumption recipients identify artificial preferably online identities indeed imbibed memes artificial arbitrary constructs 
the goal practitioner magic  far cry traditionally considered magic  change world according less known seventies last century chaos magick  postmodern imitation ancient practice acting subhuman subnatural domain world past mostly confined people born dubious talent practice peculiarity chaos magick one hand entirely syncretic ie uses everything practitioner imbibe intended subjective meaning relies virtual ie artificial world mass culture embodied internet 
the idea behind nothing true everything possible  
there many interesting implications 
the first everything interrelated ie everything connected everything else way take youll get want get hard enough second theres hierarchy higher lower  theres infinite surface dissolving ever complex elements dissolving turn nothingness concentrated upon theres nothing higher theres nothing revered everything  indeed  object ironical laughter importantly world dreams ruled usually called dream logic actual fact chaos logic unlogic

so lesser weirdness let us proceed high weirdness 


we owe reader answer question hell kek 
well reason spencer mentions magickal halfjoke kek interpreted ancient egyptian deity number internet observers identified alt right memetic avatar  pepe frog habitually suspend judgment things egyptian ancient egyptian culture slippery ground even experts consider interpretation upon closer inspection quite valid virtual light chaos logic 
namely pepe cartoon character conceived  cartoonist matt furie emerged meme depths internet forums precisely chan subforum pol devoted political discussions holds barred view observers breeding ground many alt right aficionados place absolute freedom therefore absolute chaos 
the expression kek also appropriated forums stems injoke among players world warcraft  replacing standard internet abbreviation lol laughing loud someone eventually noticed kek fact name frogheaded egyptian deity signifying chaos darkness pepe rebranded kek deity  ironic one doubt half joking one surprisingly many alt righters like put deity nonetheless 
it important point view esoteric kekists half grinning faithful kekpepe association originally entirely haphazard accidental yet developed ever growing system synchronicities  causally unrelated meaningful relations among events came pass kek sounds similar cuckoriginally cuckservative term denoting old fashioned conservative still red pilled another meme taken pop culture shared alt right conspiracy theorists alt right assume kek furthermore hillary clinton addressed pepe nothing less public enemy identifying presumably whole alt right movement cartoon character happened act hillary fainted front cameras immediately interpreted action kek

in article briefly describe main characteristics contemporary south korea also reflect upon various cultural subtopics importance male interested obtain sophisticated knowledge nonwestern cultures might might offer
the emergence modern south korea culturally politically technologically economically south korean development th century onward cannot understood without mention strong ties japan united states much japan suppressed korea  material progression nevertheless direct indirect consequence traumatic colonial period korean leaders also inspired japanese military dictatorship turn influenced european militarism south koreawhich formed  divide countrystopped relying american aid focused potential economy grew rapidly due effective exportoriented industrialization
democracy gradually introduced  authoritarian residues still visible todays society military particular also regard many companies run
presently economicpolitical relationships south korea japan remain flexible pragmatic sake countries ties us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate one hand distinguished korean culture western influences
additional ambivalence might also result koreans regard american relations hinder process future reunification two korean nations generally though political military economic cooperation south korea us appears fruitful benefit sides
the korean wave rising appeal south korea 
for quite long time modern south korea may regarded much smaller version japan although unique language differentiating characteristics postmillennial times however picture gradually shiftedboth among asians westerners people continents tootowards appealing national image
the reason mainly material related refined development technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty perhaps also exciting metropolitan nightlife better ranked top university seoul national university korean wave hallyu covers whole plethora different expressions rising popularity south korean products celebrities spillover effects sectors academia tourism instance people interested learning korean   years ago
the nightlife capital seoul unhesitatingly high standard instance year dj mag ranks club octagon gangnam fifth best night club entire world  city regions gangnam hongdae itaewon particular foreigners locals easily find bars clubs various sizes offer highquality entertainment conform relatively broad spectrum tastes music dress style
cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture described hybrid korean east asian western culture stated south korea influenced japan us particular significant extent means similar real quasihierarchical structures instance china japan visible south korea one expected speak behave different ways depending persons age social rank less explicitly stated
this largely overlap meritocratic social structure rather status primarily inherited factor doctor looked upon socially valuable regular office worker regardless family background thus much left old confucian system
the korean languageeven though  words based chinese words grammar partly similar japaneseis unique different suffixes turn conform different speech writing levels less formal plain polite always related social relations contexts either speaking writing people know well tend use intimate speech style haeche contexts workplace might change formal polite level haeyoche walk people many learn korean beginners level start haeyoche gradually broaden scope include levels speaking writing

the turning point emergence jewish zionism dominant american political force came iraq invaded kuwait discussing origins strategic complications invasion goes beyond scope introduction jewish zionist establishment seized occasion mobilized omnipresent propaganda operatives led colossal media campaigns promote military actions iraq bring war mania fruition unleashed experts directions talked iraqs formidable military capabilities saddams onemillionman standing army ready invade saudi arabia seize oil told stories saddam husseins personal life bunkers mortal nuclear threats israel talked iraqs threats us interests allies middle east    brief account events

the atmosphere followed invasion surrealistic like lightning bolt us imperialist zionist forces instantly mobilized media talking heads retired generals bogus experts middle east deafening uproar made lies told atrocities committed iraq kuwait hid definite scheme incite war  period august    january   israelis jewish zionists fields appeared en mass every possible medium available urge bush regime give diplomacy favor war january   member coalition us lion shareninetyseven percent total forceattacked iraq every standard minutia details war iraq  american war 
at end war destroyed one israels arab adversaries george h w bush might thought americas laureate hero predict though temporary freezing us loan guaranties israel would unleashed jewish zionist establishment fact lost bill clinton opposed bushs freeze stated israel country paid back debts indicated american jewish zionists finally reached objective perfect ways control us politics inside  retrospect said george h w bush last nonzionist american president bill clinton forward us presidents vice president became pawns jewish zionist play power
now united states preparing war iraq liberate kuwait thousands antiwar activists intellectuals wide spectrum political convictions spoke loudly one could ever beaten patrick j buchanans memorable words american jewish zionists israel pushing war said two groups beating drums war middle east  israeli defense ministry amen corner   buchanan hit proverbial nail head rosenthal ringleader us zionist journalism could bear heard rebuttal unleashed acerbic attack buchanan weapon argument speak stale trite accusation antisemitism
whining rosenthal twisted buchanans clear words went imply buchanan effect engaging antijewish tirade reinterpreted buchanans words cast standard zionistic fashion wrote buchanans intention jews trying drag us war jews want war israeli jews want war save israels hide american jews talk military action iraq want war would suit israeli interests willing spill american blood israeli interests 
by inserting word jew reply rosenthal new york times behind spat face us political reality tight grip zionism need waste breath rosenthals petty tactic clear objective distract central issue buchanans opposition planned war iraq unrelated religious denomination promoting rather unmistakably referring political identity
still buchanan honest pointed finger israel amen corner truth fact israelis amen corners happened jewish faith nonissue conclude evident buchanan dreamer american republic empire could stand idle seeing united states sheepishly fastened yoke zionism gutlessly prostrating tiny settler state israel
buchanan stop truthful resolute dared describe categorical terms pitiful condition us congress visvis israel american jewish zionists dubbed israelioccupied territory  buchanan powerfully hit target way countless cowardly american politicians would dare think let alone say notice buchanan placed israel us amen corner view statement clearly implied israel primary decision maker also imply us zionist groups amen corner puppets moved israel likely power setting us world agenda policies israel american jewish zionists dialectically answer israel means amen corner
now december  jim lehrer former coanchor macneillehrer newshour later sole anchor newshour jim lehrer  interviewed pat buchanan important mention jim lehrer monopolized significant position funded federal tax money  years starting  issue yes debate following applies whenever specific group people christian muslim jewish atheist duopoly party apparatchiks etc keeps important public post long duration implication unescapable group controls post embedded importance    important power keep it
nonetheless specific group continues hold throughout time important positions inside public corporations agencies branches us government paradigm emerges either group controls said corporations directlythat able want controls indirectly controlling first appoints board trustees sets corporate policies appointees rate considering type control assumption group power government public corporations reasonable
additionally issue monopoly news critical another respect means someone within context us imperialism decided us public discourse must conform predetermined patterns patterns issues israel zionism palestine us imperialism middle east wars etc designed move linear grounds without ever touching core matter

to fair lehrer consistent making intelligent questions however also consistent something else would calibrate questions way reveal new truths solicit critical replies could go beyond boundaries deliberately conceived crossed pragmatic say observance boundaries would nicely serve zionist imperialist discourse essence practice thusly followed preemptive mechanism control cloaked professional presentation
now interview lehrer played dumb asked buchanan bold characterization congress phrased question follows also said congress israelioccupied territory mean  italics mine
comment semantically much politically buchanans figure speech terse unequivocal plainly meant congress observes israels agenda acts accordingly need buchanan say anything said still basis verifiable facts question mean lehrer seeking rational reply buchanan form content question objective wanting entrap buchanan make retract least contradict show inconsistency essence lehrer simply tried deny israel controls congress amen corner mean indicated astonishment rather request explanation 
to wrap issue without exclusion denial jewish zionist control united states farce take abraham h foxman infamous antidefamation league example foxman authored masterdeceptive propaganda book called  deadliest lies  israeli lobby myth jewish control italics mine first foxman lied knew well jewish zionist control myth pervasive reality second important problem abstract jewish control specificjewish zionist control explained using current universal truth hundreds thousands jews nationalities actively oppose zionism political religious ethical historical ideological grounds
foxmans denial means one two things either parochial charlatan subject undisputed power american jewish zionism ignorant history zionism  impossible either way foxmans business propaganda demagogy deception incidentally foxmans denial looks similar arabs middle east villagersbut even city folkstry fend envy following eonold superstition fix drawing wall shops homes showing palm open hand open eye center appears foxman associates superstition decrying deadliest lies american jewish zionists try fend accusation envy jewsspecifically jewish zionistshave power influence
of substance foxman learn anyone inform john foster dulles told william knowland prozionist senator california back february  exchange proposed sanctions get israel egyptian territory occupied israel suez war dulles pronounced prophetic words cannot policies made jerusalem      today deride deny charge israel say us foreign policy wars middle east must prove making charge misinformed lying
interestingly years buchanan made statement successive events proved sharp assessment political perspicacity two people vindicated characterization capitol hills israelioccupied territory used words make point first former cia officer philip giraldi second philip weiss founder mondoweiss website article wrote  giraldi pointed congress  still occupied territory  weiss titled piece wrote   capitol hill  still israelioccupied territory

egoseparation also creates sense incompleteness separate world like fragments broken whole feel sense insufficiency kind hole inside us spend lives trying fill rarely manage like cats taken away mother birth always hankering affection attention try compensate sense lack bornagain christians mean something close say godshaped hole inside us although view traditional religion cant fill hole either provide ultimately incomplete consolation wealth success 
as result aloneness incompleteness dont feel completely home world completely rooted feel somehow adrift dont fully belong like people travelled around world much longer feel home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem perceive world benign benevolent place us seems indifferent even vaguely malevolent 
in addition egoisolation generates basic sense insecurity insignificance ego tiny flimsy face enormous world  like tiny wooden beach shack edge vast ocean feel dwarfed sheer weight phenomena events taking place  possibly significance relation fragile entity inside heads stand might world wider effects separateness 
however effects separateness reach far beyond individual fact would go far say sense separateness root cause constant conflict warfare oppression blighted human history human sense incompleteness generates craving possessions power status way trying complete compensate inner discord try complete  make significant  gaining power people collecting wealth possessions 
this desire wealth power root cause warfare oppression coupled reduced empathy separateness causes separate self walls us human beings makes difficult us feel experience world perspective makes possible us violent cruel people since cant sense suffering cause oppress exploit service desires oppress women members lower classes castes different races gain power status wealth 
the sense separateness also root cause abuse environment means experience sense otherness nature cant sense aliveness result dont feel qualms exploiting abusing separateness 
i wouldnt exactly say separateness illusion many nonduality teachers would illusion aberration  something exists shouldnt children dont experience separateness exist state natural relatedness world one reasons childhood wonderful child feels connected everything around participatory flow experience 
there also many peoples world even adults dont exist state separateness world indigenous peoples dont see separate environment feel strong sense connection nature awareness part web creation one important 
as tim ingold writes batek negritos malaysia example see involved intimate relationship interdependence plants animals hala spirits including deities inhabit world cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points indigenous peoples environment perceived sensate conscious entity suffused spiritual powers human understanding realised perfect humility sacred whole hopi use term novoitti concept living harmony nature tlingit also north america call shogan 
the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed essential characteristic native peoples limits individuality variable illdefined noted rather existing selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense identity bound community land cites reports native peoples used word speaking group others see land extension self forced away land would tantamount death native peoples often prepared commit suicide rather leave lands 
the naming practices certain peoples suggest us name permanent label defines individuality autonomy australian aborigines example fixed names keep throughout lives names regularly change include members tribe native peoples use tekonyms terms describe relationship two people instead personal kinship names 
the sense separateness seems quirk psychological development us slowly develops move adolescence becoming firmly established late teens ego develops structure creating sense innerness walling us 
witness massive change occurs child enters adolescence especially boys freshness joy childhood gives way dullness confusion part glorious flow experience suddenly outside world alone inside mental space adolescents strong need belonging 
their new sense separation makes feel vulnerable need reinforce identity part groups gangs following fashions bleakly also murders committed young men response perceived slights insults new fragile sense identity young men liable take offence kind trivial affront making feel belittled creating instant desire take revenge regain lost status 
i remember transition clearly adolescence carefree childhood suddenly felt locked inside alone thoughts feelings one else would ever able experience along felt acute selfconsciousness aware every movement made every word spoke couldnt anything naturally anymore felt exposed walked street aware people could looking windows 
as grow adulthood people deal fragility vulnerability self taking roles attachments take roles jobs attach certain beliefs strengthening identity labels socialists atheists muslims attach ambitions knowledge theyve accumulated selfimage important powerful people emotionally attach people roles attachments become scaffolding ego propping time reinforce separation making individual walled awakening sleep separateness 
however matter far separateness fall sense never superficial matter strong ego becomes never construct everyone experiences moments separateness temporarily fades become part unity refer awakening experiences frequently occur walking amongst natural surroundings dancing running sex listening playing music situations normal chattering ego normal fuel ego maintaining structure becomes quiet leading softening boundaries separateness dissolves afloat ocean immersed glorious isness aliveness world 
tellingly moments always identity shift feel weve become someone else deeper grounded self seems authentically egoself identified seems like imposter limited shallow trickster somehow deluded us thinking identity 
there also many cases extreme loss intense turmoil egos building blocks roles attachments broken away person might diagnosed cancer told months left live alcoholic might reach rock bottom point suicide person might become seriously disabled injury illness might suffer trauma bereavement depression destruction hopes beliefs cases forms loss simply bring sadness suffering minority individuals trigger spiritual awakening scaffolding broken normal egoself dissolves away deeper truer self emerges place like butterfly caterpillar person feels reborn like different person inhabiting body new sense meaning connection 
in experiences sense coming home back original oneness harmony individual species fell away always always separate selves deluded us thinking asleep

it true first glance men dominate every field business pokmon go achievements  lead think conspiracy women male superiority many fields exactly allows society prosper years humiliating debunking wage gap time address real elephant room fact women dont pay taxes
a research report fiscal contribution men women across age groups published victoria university wellington  lets explore key findings

this wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred wage gap womens preference low paying jobs among others factor play another factor amount women working part time average week women research  hours  men workforce participation rate differ men women significant ways

this disposable income income remaining deduction taxes mandatory charges available spent saved one wishes see progressive taxes unfairly impact males  reduces males disposable income near womens although market income almost double womens disproportionately affects men  assured one complain

those raw taxes paid men women tax gap oddly never gender issue now

when tax money received men women included equation see womens lives except   receive tax money supply state men hand give state tax money receive   years

this gets upsetting see womens short period positive fiscal impact doesnt come close counterbalance already massive overall negative impact net fiscal incidence men approximately zero accumulated ages society invests young males subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs society taught see underprivileged
by end life average woman cost  average taxpayer means average man extorted  lifetime directly transferred women men could use money women would chase men much men chase women nowadays
there confounds need ruled authors mention specifically health education costs almost equal men women also workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference men women women dont spend children either according report even confounds needed accounted something feminists done cent wage gap compared raw percentages without accounting confounding factors
also numbers include massive costs governmental budget womens issues massive burden state instance local government canadian province  million people announced  plan fight sexual violence women  two immigrants dingdongditched women student house 
add millions invested sexed programs feminist teaches boys porn movies tailored shouldnt imitated instead partners pleasure mind teaching exact opposite girls government takes money males empower women hating men contribution society
httpstcornbrpfws qubec canada announces  million plan sexual violence two foreigners touched female students
 nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   

the data also doesnt include money directly personally transferred man woman instance women make little still account  consumer purchases  wondering marketers desperately try appeal women advertisements
a metaphor male taxpayers women real danone ad watch see comment 
the defense feminists use confronted facts women invest much time children however feminists made clear past decades womans contribution society shouldnt based involvement children moreover birth rates half necessary  birthrate population stability theyre also children thing pretty badly
these findings raise serious question would feminism survive libertarian regime doesnt involve male tax money coincidence women consistently vote welfare state within  years womens suffrage usa government doubled tax expenditure revenue  womens voting patterns made government become new providing husband time providing husband doesnt get woman children return remove taxes woman ever claim strong independent woman state cucking little like prostitution legal free  guys would probably strong independent single males
pretty ironic institution gives money women pregnant prevents paid less makes abortions affordable entirely supported men feminists seriously living society entirely supported men men autonomy wealth create male wealth public good female wealth body choice

consider facts figure odds alive 

 wikileaks dns server suddenly pointed elsewhere thats right night wee hours morning pamela poison police armored vehicle showed embassy night dns server pointed different ip address wikileaks google updated everything instantly transfer completely seamless real wikileaks server fake wikileaks server completely different ip address 

 mr assanges subsequent tweets noticeably hostile attacked loyal supporters reported repeatedly 

 mr assanges tweets regularly misspelled names closest friends known decades gavin mcfadyen became mcfayden example mcfadyen  director wikileaks found dead three days assange started mystery problems something made huge issue 

 streams disinformation spewed 

 themes supported mr assange years knocked discredited subsequent tweets communications bad timing everyone brain noticed lit forums blogs 

 body double rumors circulated documented 

 new strange hitherto unknown moderators wikileaks suddenly installed 

 deadman switch activated armored vehicle even showed embassy means assange probably manually triggered figured poisoned much stored data secret website pins released event untimely death released deadman switches one encrypted one unencrypted 

all happened right pamela anderson showed lunch doubt poisoned media talked assange pale feeling well left said food pamela brought torture good laugh inside circles go msm doubt 

my take assange poisoned removed embassy armored vehicle clearly visible live feed someone set night something amiss saw stayed entire night strongly stated cant possibly still embassy perhaps got medical care save waterboarded 

if new wikileak releases real coming wikileaks server  redirect different server name wikileaks ip address change proves hope white hats seems one guess

for familiar bond market yields go bond prices go bond prices go bad news economic growth 
so generally dont want yields go 
unfortunately yields absolutely soaring past couple weeks yield  year treasury notes jumped one full percentage point since july  
the year treasury yield jumped  late trading friday highest since december   basis point since election one full percentage point since july 
the year yield critical juncture terms reality first thing might happen rate increase fed december year flipflopping slew postelection pronouncements fed heads  including yellens relatively soon  pushed odds rate hike  
as noted day  many things financial system tied yields us treasury notes look happening mortgages wolf richter noted  average rate  year mortgages shooting stratosphere 
the carnage bonds consequences average interest rate conforming year fixed mortgage friday quoted  top credit scores thats  percentage point election according mortgage news daily  put month short list  worst months decade 
if mortgage rates continue shoot higher another housing crash 
rates auto loans credit cards student loans also affected throughout economic system become much costly borrow money inevitably slow overall economy 
why bond investors edge days statements one steve bannon  
in nascent administration seems best random beliefs bannon seem focused voice almost messianic one 
like andrew jacksons populism going build entirely new political movement says everything related jobs conservatives going go crazy im guy pushing trilliondollar infrastructure plan negative interest rates throughout world greatest opportunity rebuild everything ship yards iron works get jacked going throw wall see sticks exciting greater reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists economic nationalist movement

sadly comes time us economy already starting show significant signs slowing projected see sixth straight decline yearoveryear earnings sp  industrial production contracted  months row  
the truth economy barely treading water quite time isnt going take much push us edge following comes lance roberts  
with economy running  consumers already heavily indebted wage growth weak bulk americans lot wiggle room policy mistakes 
combine weak economics higher interest rates negatively impacts consumption stronger dollar weighs exports real potential recession occurring sooner rather later 
yes stock market soared immediately following trumps election wasnt economic conditions actually improved 
if look history stock market crash almost always follows major bond crash bond prices keep declining rapidly going ominous sign stock traders 
and history also shown us bull market survive major recession economy suffers major downturn early trump administration inevitable stock prices follow 
the waning days obama administration set us perfectly higher interest rates major recession giant stock market crash 
of course problems occur january th  blamed trump truth obama far responsible happens trump 
right many people lulled sense complacency donald trump election

by way dont give free pass mainstream conservative establishment either unfortunately government countless ways seeks amass power producing fear dependency populace really democrat problem republican problem theyre basically two sides coin heads win tails lose
surely youre favor progress one good question though exactly constitutes  also gets define progress might seem rhetorical important matters likely see change good thing whos setting agenda deciding direction change goes actually answers that

au vu de la dimension mondiale des problmes et menaces actuels et de la ncessit dlaborer des stratgies collectives pour les combattre efficacement il est essentiel de renforcer la coopration entre lonu et les organisations rgionales et sousrgionales dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la scurit
pour ce qui est de lonu il sagit avant tout de tirer parti de son caractre universel aussi bien au niveau de ses membres que de ses activits ainsi que de sa lgitimit mondialement reconnue les organisations rgionales quant  elles connaissent souvent mieux la situation dans les rgions relevant de leur comptence et dans de nombreux cas sont dotes de mcanismes de prvention et de maintien de la paix adapts aux ralits locales il importe  cet gard que les activits des organisations rgionales tendent  trouver des solutions pacifiques et politiques aux conflits mergents
dans ce contexte il est particulirement important que lonu et ses principaux partenaires rgionaux se coordonnent rgulirement sur les questions ayant trait au maintien de la paix et de la scurit internationales ainsi le conseil de scurit tient rgulirement des sances sur la coopration avec lunion africaine lorganisation pour la scurit et la coopration en europe et lunion europenne ces dernires annes un examen galement men sur la coopration avec la ligue des tats arabes lassociation des nations de lasie du sudest lunion des nations de lamrique du sud et dautres organisations rgionales
comme le sait la collaboration entre lonu et ses partenaires rgionaux couvre un nombre toujours plus grand de questions aux activits de maintien et de consolidation de la paix sont venues sajouter la lutte contre la prolifration des armes de destruction massive et le trafic darmes lgres et de petit calibre ainsi que la lutte contre le cyberterrorisme et la migration illgale domaines dans lesquels la coopration entre les organisations concernes et lonu est de plus en plus troite cette coopration joue un rle essentiel dans le maintien de la paix et de la stabilit  lchelle de leurasie et plus particulirement en asie centrale
cest prcisment dans ce domaine quuvrent trois organisations relativement jeunes dans une vaste zone stendant de leurope orientale  lextrmeorient  savoir lorganisation du trait de scurit collective otsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopration et la communaut dtats indpendants cei de plus en plus influentes sur la scne politique mondiale ces organisations contribuent considrablement au renforcement de la scurit rgionale et internationale
le dbat sera ax sur le rle de ces trois organisations dans la lutte contre les menaces qui psent sur la paix et la scurit dans la rgion notamment le terrorisme le trafic de drogues et la criminalit organise il permettra galement  ces organisations de raffirmer leur volont de renforcer la coopration sur le plan pratique avec lonu notamment avec son centre rgional pour la diplomatie prventive en asie centrale
lotsc est une structure pluridimensionnelle  mme de ragir rsolument aux divers problmes et menaces actuels auxquels peuvent faire face ses tats membres  cet gard le resserrement de la coopration entre lonu est lotsc dans le domaine du maintien de la paix est prometteur lotsc dploie dimportants efforts pour renforcer ses propres capacits de maintien de la paix qui pourront aussi tre mises  la disposition des oprations de maintien de la paix des nations unies elle contribue activement en outre aux actions menes sur le plan international pour reconstruire lafghanistan aprs le conflit et pour carter la menace que reprsentent les stupfiants provenant de ce pays
ses relations avec lonu se rvlent fructueuses dans de nombreux domaines comme la lutte contre le terrorisme et le trafic de drogues le maintien de la paix ou la lutte contre la criminalit organise lotsc entretient et dveloppe des rapports productifs avec les entits spcialises de lonu notamment le comit contre le terrorisme du conseil de scurit et loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime
tous les deux ans lassemble gnrale adopte une rsolution sur la coopration entre lonu et lotsc et il est prvu quelle en adopte une  sa soixante et onzime session au titre du point de lordre du jour intitul  coopration entre lorganisation des nations unies et les organisations rgionales ou autres 
les fondements juridiques de la coopration entre lonu et lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopration dans le domaine du maintien de la paix et de la scurit internationales au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies ont poss  la suite de la signature en  de la dclaration conjointe sur la coopration entre les secrtariats des deux organisations actuellement lorganisation de shanghai et lonu collaborent troitement dans des domaines tels que la prvention et le rglement des conflits la lutte contre le terrorisme linstance rgionale de lutte contre le terrorisme relevant de lorganisation de shanghai uvre  cette fin la nonprolifration des armes de destruction massive la lutte contre la criminalit transnationale et le trafic de drogues et la scurit informatique internationale
dans ce contexte lorganisation de shanghai appuie activement les efforts dploys par la communaut internationale et les organismes des nations unies pour rtablir la paix en afghanistan se prononant toujours en faveur du maintien du rle central de coordination de lonu dans le rglement du conflit afghan
quant  la cei la scurit et la lutte contre les menaces actuelles ont toujours et demeurent un des domaines prioritaires de coopration entre ses tats membres
une coopration constructive avec les organisations internationales est galement essentielle pour contrer les menaces mergentes les pays de la cei sont parties  tous les principaux instruments internationaux rgissant la coopration dans les domaines de la scurit du dsarmement et de la lutte contre les menaces actuelles et contribuent efficacement  leur mise en uvre
des mesures conjointes sont prises compte tenu du rle moteur de lonu et de la ncessit dtablir des partenariats constructifs avec dautres institutions internationales et leurs entits spcialises comme le comit contre le terrorisme loffice des nations unies contre la drogue et le crime lorganisation internationale de police criminelle interpol lorganisation internationale pour les migrations le hautcommissariat des nations unies pour les rfugis et le groupe daction financire sur le blanchiment des capitaux
llargissement et le renforcement de la coopration entre lonu et lotsc lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopration et la cei au titre du chapitre viii de la charte des nations unies semble contribuer de manire constructive  la ralisation des objectifs de lonu compris  llimination des menaces et problmes actuels dune part ces organisations rgionales doivent activement envisager de mettre leurs capacits au service de lonu et dautre part lonu doit continuer daccorder lattention voulue au renforcement de la coordination et de la coopration avec ces organisations dans le strict respect de ses propres prrogatives et de celles de son conseil de scurit
dans ce contexte nous invitons les tats membres de lonu  exposer leurs ides sur les moyens de renforcer la scurit dans la rgion eurasienne avec laide des mcanismes rgionaux existants force est de constater que la stabilit de cette vaste rgion est une condition sine qua non de la croissance conomique et de ldification de ltat des pays de leurasie et nous serions par consquent reconnaissants aux dlgations de nous faire part de leurs vues notamment en ce qui concerne les liens entre scurit et dveloppement nous sommes convaincus quici dans le cadre de lonu qui jouit dune lgitimit universelle nous serons tous ensemble en mesure de proposer des stratgies novatrices visant la stabilisation des rgions vulnrables susceptibles par la suite dtre mises en uvre dans dautres rgions du monde qui sont au centre des proccupations du conseil de scurit
le secrtaire gnral de lonu ban kimoon le secrtaire gnral de lotsc nikola bordiouja le secrtaire gnral de lorganisation de shanghai pour la coopration rachid alimov et le viceprsident du comit excutif de la cei serguei ivanov feront un expos lors du dbat les tats membres des organisations rgionales susmentionnes et les reprsentants dautres tats intresss sont invits  participer  la runion"

how could steal election trump even announced winner next tuesday 
by dr patrick slattery  great deal talk recently rigging elections trump talks media accuses threat democracy refusing accept voters nobody asks hillary accept voters 
of course know electoral system unfair biased even rigged variety levels without going detail media plays absolutely crucial role staging elections abandoned even pretense neutrality ballot access unfair campaign finance corrupt electronic voting machines vulnerable voting foreigners dead people exists multiple voting individuals 
but one massive threat far gone completely unmentioned vulnerability electoral college postelection shenanigans 
what people aware constitution president elected november  tuesday first monday november designated congressional elections happens years states decided electors electoral college selected voters day early days republic actually common state legislatures select electors constitution allows state legislatures determine electors selected 
it actually electoral college elects president happens monday second wednesday december year december  day electors meet respective state capitals cast ballots sent washington opened vice president biden joint session congress january  next year may remember scene michael moores fahrenheit  showing vice president gore reading votes elected president bush ironically denying objections raised congressmen floridas electoral votes bush gore amidst greatest controversy 
so system enshrined constitution could possibly go wrong plenty 
unless hillary goes complete meltdown next week trump victory november  likely narrow one terms electoral college map one plausible scenario trump losing pennsylvania winning rest main battleground states plus one maines congressional districts maine along nebraska allow electors elected congressional district basis rather winnertakeall scenario  republican electors would elected bare majority  democrat electors would elected 
notice say trump would get  electoral votes used hearing fact electoral votes cast december  guarantee every single one  republican electors would actually vote trump remember months ago alarmed prospect supposed trump delegates republican national convention deserting trump voting cruz trump piled large victories final primaries big enough majority delegates cause never trump people republican establishment give rigging convention 
so electors method electing electors left states method nominating candidates electoral college also left states states allow presidential candidates nominate slate electors presumably people could counted loyal states partys slate electors chosen state party conventions even electoral district conventions 
as young man attended one convention name put nomination democratic elector three contenders made short speeches convention three talked precinct captains hardworking party volunteers gave speech calling direct election president abolition electoral college got huge round applause would easily matter principle withdrew name nomination 
the point story electors unknown public typically cogs party apparatus even necessarily highlevel ones may even smoothtalking slicksters like unknown party 
so likely one republican electors would betray trump person known faithless elector faithless electors never ultimately altered outcome presidential election  faithless electors history fact faithless electors caused congress decide  election vice president 
it true half states laws punishing faithless voters states votes faithless electors would still count 
the nightmare situation would close election hillary people never trump people could bribe pressure republican electors may like trump anyway vote trump could vote hillary could vote pence could vote anyone else could even abstain voting 
then happens enough republican electors cajoled voting hillary  scenario would require two hillary gets inaugurated january  tie house representatives breaks tie obviously republican members house say wont vote trump president november reason assume would vote january 
however republicans likely retain significant majority house voting president house one vote representative one vote per state means california currently  democratic representatives would get one vote alaskas single representative republican would also get one vote heavily favors republicans means hillary cannot flip enough republican electors win majority electoral votes finished real prospect house representative electing hillary 
but enough republican electors vote people paul ryan example candidate gets majority house representatives gets choose top three vote finishers electoral college vote could get coalition democrats republican defectors would deny trump presidency give someone like ryan applies case mormon excia operative nevertrump independent presidential candidate evan mcmullen wins utah  polls predict possible

i find seeing everything around rectangular framesa takeaway frame many pictures years oh people would fit perfectly  box building would look perfect boxed angle eyes sharper ever

my prephotographer self like rest world would walked right past things without care world yet entertained minuscule simple things especially camera handy world full photogenic things teach notice  help preserve history 
since inception photography always one moving ways preserve history rapidly changing modern times photos touch people way media cant photography video visual arts photographs differ capture merely one frame going yet one frame one needs feel taken back another time 
with advent smartphone photography accessible ever sounds good paper truth worlds becoming flooded garbage narcissistic photographs world needs adventurous welltrained photographers taking photos modern world live rapid changes undergoing photos cherished decades road shitty selfies bog social media  travel experiences meaningful 
photography goes traveling like bread goes butter took nearly five years traveling internationally finally get serious photography trips got started never looked back 
rather traveling escapism hedonism im traveling learn document world result trips feel much meaningful fulfilling ever way see come understand country photographer quite different werent one 
i divide history travel experiences two separate groupsthe trips owned dslr camera trips buying one photography fun addicting find wanting go back predslr camera destinations even ones didnt enjoy much reexperience camera hand  opportunity meet new people 
one thing always try travel meet fellow photographers whether foreign local appreciate talking people observational eye provide unique insight nonphotographers rarely 
but photography doesnt help meet photographers helps meet people walks life ive regular people street come talk saw taking photos ive also met people online reason liked work 
being good photographer also great way meet women theyre gonna start blowing soon see awesome pictures dont surprised discover newfound female admiration excellent photography skills open make woman look beautiful photo shell admire way never imagined  blog edge

and although helpful dont actually need another photographer get good shots rather need camera autofocus lens tripod remote shutter creative eye  resumeenhancing marketable skill 
photography isnt mentally rewarding also financially rewarding play cards right field profitable photography may vast highly competitive one things sure  demand new photographs infinite world never stops turning stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports news photography demand profitable niches 
but really wanna make money selling photographs gotta make name sharpening skills networking right people great photographer one knows exists wont make money

while rarely stated explicitly way american electoral politics supposed work population spends several months listening candidates accuse terrible crimes horrible ideas gross incompetence candidate lists ways use power government force winners policy preferences losers votes cast everyone supposed quickly accept results ignore everything said campaign immediately accept winner indisputable mandate rule everyone including sizable minority  even majority many cases  either voted winner abstained appears irregularities vote well ignored would tear country apart drag election half country feels cheated well tough luck better luck next time democracy breaks perceived interventionism increases 
this model work indefinitely certain specific conditions workable perception government limited power extensive abrupt change government institutions thought rare also work small culturally uniform society relatively small divide socioeconomic ethnic groups

the first deal  la norway full access common market also full implementation eu law contribution eu budget case every member state second option would trade treaty one negotiated eu canada however viable third opportunity exists unilateral freetrade 
contrary often assumed unilateralism simply utopian libertarian ideal cannot reached todays world unilateral free trade genuine freetrade also pragmatic efficient strategy foster commerce peace theresa may seems ready conduct interventionist industrial economic policy oddly resembles french planning existed freemarket policy paradigm likely transform postbrexit britain flourishing economy 
unilateral free trade british tradition 
the tradition unilateral free trade tightly linked uk victory liberals britain became strongly committed unilateral free trade  least  free trade politically unassailable trade treaties however seen inherently suspicious sir robert peel announcing repeal corn laws house commons  brilliantly warned 
i trust government  resume policy found inconvenient namely haggling foreign countries reciprocal concessions instead taking independent course believe conducive interests  let us trust example proof practical benefits derive remote period insure adoption principles acted  let therefore commerce free institutions let us proclaim commerce free nation nation follow example repeal corn laws result intense political effort especially cobden anticorn law league made case unilateral free trade cobden later years explained 
we came conclusion less attempted persuade foreigners adopt trade principles better discovered much suspicion motives england lending argument protectionists abroad incite popular feeling freetraders  take away pretense avowed total indifference whether nations became freetraders abolish protection selves leave countries take whatever course liked best argue uk soon departed unilateral free trade cobdenchevalier treaty  cobden supported negotiated less known however treaty primarily way avoid conflict orsinis attempt murder napolon iii  emperor convinced orsini support cause italian independence italian question brought england edge war france strongly antimilitarists cobden chevalier looked trade treaty primarily way adopt free trade way establish friendship france england gladstone ardent unilateralist retrospect held two alternatives one french treaty  war france cobden felt treaty gods method produce entente cordiale 
commercially treaty incredible success mainly supervised bureaucrats  case today trade treaties  two prominent free traders cobden aware dangers real free trade contained negotiations trade treaties proceeded carefully cobden wrote letter great british free trader john bright undertake syllable side treaty inconsistent soundest principles free trade nonetheless bright remained skeptic remarked 
governments seem rule standing conspiracies rob bamboozle people louis napoleon exception see rulers world less wisdom greatness find necessary government mankind convince cobden benefits brought treaty michel chevalier showed unilateral reductions tariffs bright asked could constitute british side bargain could extended nations thus avoiding clear violation british unilateralism 
free trade without 
the unilateral free trade program simple british parliament declares abolition tariffs avoid race nontariff barriers parliament pass law declaring every product conforms eu norms regulations sold freely uk problem since uk still member eu parliaments act nontariff barrier problem withers away without need regulatory harmonization eu legislator considers necessary regulate curvature vegetables although eu producers free sell product uk british legislator may deem unnecessary regulate producers absurd way 
the advantages approach many first uk free trade instead waiting years negotiations need wait bureaucrats agree laws burden consumers producers 
the comprehensive economic trade agreement ceta example eu canada contrasts expediency unilateralism endless negotiations negotiations ceta started october  finished august  treaty effective eu member state still ratify worse european federal member states treaty must agreed upon local federated states wallonia recently vetoed ceta thus threatening work sixyearlong negotiation case uk  whether trade treaties actually advancing free trade  british economy cannot afford wait long free trade 
the second major advantage unilateralism message send brussels signifying eu apparatus without free trade point eu leverage left uk negotiation trade treaty hand hopelessly utopian solution obvious coordination problem  eu member states also eu vested interest making sure brexit fails eurocrats starting contestable assumption uk much lose eu try concoct deal bad possible fellow anglosaxon neighbors 
free trade first negotiations later 
still possible declared free trade unilaterally eu decide restrict access british corporations single market particularly valid concern financial sector banks financial institutions need licenses operate eu member states concern unilateral free trade respecting remove leverage british government negotiate favorable access actual potential commercial partners without treaty commercial partners thought soon erect protectionist barriers 
unilateral free trade however mean uk producers bullied without government able respond first declaring unilateral free trade maintained strength commercial links made make much easier negotiate eu antagonize good client would foolish lets forget past decade british exports eu grew much slower exports rest world time uk major consumer eu products balance commerce eu negative  billion  
but country committed unilateralism make sure countries close markets let us first remark maintaining trade barriers negotiate later nations selfdefeating strategy sir robert peel mentioned earlier said  case wine brandy reduce duty hoped might employ duties instruments negotiation view effecting reduction duties imposed countries produce country strategy selfdefeating tariffs view negotiation reducing capacity foreigners produce british market destroying interests wanted free trade peel finally admitted  debate house commons bound say interest buy cheap whether countries buy cheap 
there certainly efficient policy maintaining trade barriers threatening raise order force trade partners keep markets open indeed british government make clear eu unfairly penalizes british interests sectors eg finance british government work maintain competitiveness industry question aggressively lowering taxes imagine eu wants damage britains car manufacturers british government afraid create loophole lower manufacturers corporate taxes  even zero economy never globalized competitive today uk would good chances prevailing eu interests 
perhaps eu consider making trading conditions uk harder would way much lose means creating fiscally ultraattractive market next door short run unilateralism trade achieve multilateralism cannot quick radical liberalization exchanges long run unilateralism achieve multilateralism cannot genuine free trade"

so elaborate projects ideas reforming depraved societies empire nothinga necessary step want lasting victoryan important question must confronted need called intellectuals last centuries instead origin modern intellectuals

the momentous crisis turned crisis structure structure turned mark modern west god ceased speak modern talking head took territory wrote dozens books trying prove embodiment progress doesnt matter problems genuine artificial intellectuals need like blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters voltaire mile zola gifted writers charming witty managed write matters actually relevant times used trial political overtones make show incidentally french participated furthering twisted literary chauvinism

when guistra sold majority stake company uranium one rosatom russian atomic energy agency approved secretary state hillary clinton giustra contributed  million clinton foundation bill clinton offered  speaking engagement russian investment bank links kremlin sound like playing rules hillarys trying make us believe russias meddling elections threatening confrontation russia syria dont think shes kidding confrontation clinton foundation rarely passes chance make another million dollars circumstances
meanwhile rest us living american dream sixtythree percent americans living edge financial catastrophe unable handle  car repair  emergency room bill  clintons said serve oligarchy also managed join bill clinton way last months presidency worked republicans lame duck congress deregulate banking industry  dishonest excessive abusive financialization scams crashed economy costing millions americans jobs andor homes new york senator hillary clinton voted bail big banks committed crime many rest us struggled crashs wake
how explain candidate clinton failed secretary state death us ambassador libya health problems scandal emails candidate democrats
again clinton serves interests oligarchy joined many people believe nomination stolen bernie sanders democratic candidate spoke oligarchy growing income inequality even israeli lobbys dominance american politics
but theres one important element americans identify liberals supporters womens rights andor antiracists longstanding allegiance democratic party supporting nominee every four years kneejerk reaction ever escalating foreign wars dont seem penetrate consciousness conscience especially wars waged primarily drones proxy armies instead us troops republicans nominated openly racist misogynistic donald trump defeating trump became liberal crusade
there course glimmers rationality hope yesterday canvassing oakland california ballot measure young black man college sophomore despite trumps overt racism told considers clinton even dangerous understands essentially promised confrontation russia syria understands escalation increases chance nuclear war accidental trump faults says cold war nato largely obsolete clinton recklessly risking confrontation russia promising remove bashar alassad
our green party presidential candidate jill stein reported polling  among voters  much bernie sanderss support quite visibly age group local grassroots organizing also empowering people create institutions free oligarchic corporate control include community gardens renewable energy buyers cooperatives gmofree zones ballot initiative make californias sonoma county gmofree passes whole northwest coast california gmofree zone santa cruz humboldt counties including one inland county trinity
dont think twoheaded american system candidates two traditional parties democratic republican breath
i wouldnt say breath still much control however trump left republican party disarray many republican luminaries funders defecting clinton welcoming open arms black agenda report editor glen ford written  clintons succeeded assembling one party roof nearly whole us ruling class hordes attendants goons scam undergirded duopoly system served lords capital well long come undone thanks white nationalist billionaire spoiled play corporate rules two parties ruling class become one
its hard say whether republican party survive election another four years does
one possibility could significantly change green party presidential candidate dr jill stein wins  election green party become official national party eligible  federal funds made available official national parties host presidential nominating conventions support nominee year federal funds went two official national parties republicans democrats also access huge amounts plutocratic corporate money greens take corporate money
five percent vote five percent federal funding elections may sound like much would huge watershed us greens would big psychological visibility boost would mean starting next presidential campaign year twice funds jill steins campaign able raise
winning  would also ensure ballot access greens states federal elections also ballot races greens required spend much time money gathering enough signatures satisfy byzantine ballot access requirements vary  states
everyone knows clinton future president usa opinion facilitated task interest seeing clinton oval office
she backed oligarchy corporate dynastic particularly investment bankers oil industry weapons manufacturers profit also lobby foreign wars advancing interests promoting candidate serve liberals conditioned function unpaid clinton operatives election corporate media like cops serve protectors oligarchy majority americans politically disengaged
you close jill stein head green party emerged late campaign alternative sabotaged
well wouldnt say im close jill personally knows course know ive reported campaign us greens past year radio print online outlets im always honored shares reports social media pages write black agenda report feel politically intellectually close editors given full support green party year even bernie sanders surged polls many imagined might actually win democratic nomination times easy see end times shared rationality humanity closest bonds many us regardless geographic distance us
jills campaign could hardly compete republicans democrats neither greens solicit accept corporate money stand behind slogan people planet profits call halt death march led weapons manufacturers fossil fuel giants agrochemical companies profit jill calls immediately cutting military budget half closing us military bases foreign countries launching peace offensive proposes free public education kindergarten college abolition student debt national health insurance green new deal would reinvest resources squandered weapons manufacture illegal immoral lethal environmentally catastrophic us wars green new deal would create renewable energy infrastructure sustainable agriculture late stop climate meltdown  isnt late already would fully employ americans meaningful dignified cooperative work common good
of course makes far much sense threatens highly concentrated wealth power deathmarch industries would surprised voter fraud prevent jill stein ajamu baraka winning  would make us official national party
i also seen enormous oligarchic determination stop greens local level  matt gonzalez green partys mayoral candidate san francisco seemed good chance winning alarmed democratic party sent best known powerful names faces san francisco campaign democratic candidate sent hillary bill sent jesse jackson sent many democratic party superstars seemed concerned defeating matt gonzalez greens san francisco defeating george bush republicans following years presidential election
one founders san francisco green party elected city county board supervisors twice ran sheriff executive office democrats pulled aside said could allow election unless left greens joined democratic party still got rid first term really ugly campaign thats another complicated story city county san francisco elected greens city county country many greens worked hard elect since defected democratic party sake political careers
is hillary clinton danger humanity
hell yes agree congolese author political activist patrick mbeko said shes dangerous isis reasons ive already mentioned dark alliance deathmarch industries seeming eagerness confront russia syria andor russias borders interest global hegemony russian uranium deal aside think diana johnstone likely right wrote strategic ambition nutshell regime change russia

first wouldnt call leadership id say france sustains neocolonial military presence africa france partner destruction libya mali niger central african republic democratic republic congo france protecting uranium mines essential nuclear power generates  electricity theres doubt france complicit assassination resource nationalist debt resister president thomas sankara installation president blaise compaor burkina faso dont see sign french policy towards burkina former colonies benign despite resignation compaors ouster popular movement
france us appear military partners africa often rwandan war massacres congo wars us displaced france dominant power there

while africa young continent explain countries often directed old presidents several mandates dont want lose power
the old presidents cling power western powers geostrategic interests enable autocrats easier corrupt control rowdy democrats resource nationalists try represent people rwandas kagame ugandas museveni two prime examples autocrats proven useful us western interests

this factor represents first step one must take become cuckservative entails believing series premises patently false political naivet include simpler forms believing wage gap illegal immigrants natural republicans conversely political naivet also complex individual afflicted might believe equality virtue democratic two party system best form government 
a perfect example seen friends associates blindly believe constitution individuals refuse vote anyone constitutionalist sole metric judging candidates implications obscure constitutional issue care perspective indicative political naive globalists run political system jettisoned belief constitution rule law decades ago constitution merely convenient rubber stamp used justify unpopular political decisions

relationships among friends treat first first step process make evaluation determine whether relationship worth saving rehabilitating simple fact life relationships expiration date two people longer anything common paths take divergent directions may difficult find common ground situation always better let relationship die natural death slowly rather rapidly abrupt terminations may leave party negative feelings avoided possible
there instances repair possible someone committed fundamental violation trust respect warning sign person never friend first place another point keep mind repair broken relationship requiresno demandsthe participation parties person unwilling participate process efforts futile come nothing

once determined friendship worth repairing sustaining next step decide make first approach party must try evaluate reasons problems first place make honest assessment things got someone say something caused hard feelings side intervening cause made two parties diverge plans activities types questions must honestly repeatedly asked tendency minimize hurtful actions exaggerate others must kept mind
the key rule point try put shoes party must try see things friends perspective many people difficult involves getting past feelings hurt rejection shoes person yet essential frequently reasons strained broken friendships lies fact problem going persons life perceptive student human nature divine cause sometimes thing caused strained relationship misunderstanding easily curable

thank taking time address important issue regarding professor hall like stunned voracity dr mahons action used think academics certain reputation reach tentacles establishment hoped president would resort shameless pandering special interest group however bnai brith special interest group perhaps vindictive organization ever received prominence west allow elaborate
you correctly identified bnai brith behind movement shutting free speech statement accurate phenomenon targeting canadian universities canadian society something started long ago used branded hidden hand behind hidden hand harper era operation became fullblown politically driven policy directive legislation dr mahon pathetically relies upon product harper era harper extremist rightwing background organizations like bnai brith channelled extremism accomplish hateful agenda early personally observed spirit unholy union tenure president muslim student association university alberta although harper didnt attend university far epicentre neoconservatism movement brewing canada fastforward  years come upon type events professor hall travesty products time fact web operations full force sometime every aspect canadian lives recently court ruling canadian security intelligence service illegally spying public gangsterlike involvement started  shortly harper neocon came power
this say public protected unconscionable manoeuvring liberal government fact notorious scandals involving government human rights erupted liberal regime take instance case omar khadr travesty 
more creating antimuslim bias canadian university suspension tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates public sphere irish human rights activists freedom speech case something known albeit late intervene time subsequently discredited publicly even harper regime  overwhelming theme pointed barely  year old omar khadr said  dont care  defines mindset people bent extremism extremism subdue public conscience
the attack professor hall particularly toxic equally sinister attacks taken place decade ago defunct canadian islamic congress faced onslaught sides based planted stories baited manoeuvring largest muslim organization time canadian muslims became largest religious minority one particular episode involved bnai briths planted story involving university professor became target hate crime time investigated hate crime wasnt humane civic behaviour university president current governor general david johnston would become career threatening life threatening event professor top university personnel told private university faced pressure donors wanted professor disappear academic well public arena vendetta sort beggars belief even today dont know many assaults conscience took place brewing

living south east asia pros cons like anywhere else decided return west ill always connection asia im sure ill back many times throughout life
so whats real story living asia cracked man aware coming lets look six common stereotypical ideas living south east asia assess light reality
 asian women kind gentle compliant husbands sweet fast
this definitely myth come expecting find little house pet bidding youll rude awakening
its definitely true asian women experience lot traditional give man place house rarely question final decisions resent housework basic wifely duties
however idea theyll whatever tell without question nonsense theyre human beings wouldnt first guy get smack head fivefoottwo broad weighs  pounds disrespect her
the idea asian women sort angelic alternative western women also nonsense norm ive met several western men taken cleaners asian wives girlfriends move youre completely mercy never legal rights citizen
asian women generally lot traditional stereotype theyre sort perfect wife material got go theyre individualsand kinds good bad among them
read guide dating asian women complete perspective issue thorny subject theres lot misunderstanding surrounding it
 asia ridiculously cheap 
this one id lean slightly towards agreeing with
most things asia lot cheaper eating entire family often costs less  meaning afford basically every day rent condo apartment costs less  month although thats mostly live sticks major city
a general rule thumb outside major cities like bangkok singapore kl divide cost living three get rough estimate
note apply consumer goods cars electrical appliances around price certainly apply luxury goods often much expensive taxes placed local governments
asia cheaper overall anything basics costs roughly life south east asia cheaper isnt necessarily soit depends lifestyle
 become citizen asian country stay forever becoming citizen asian country nigh impossible even could probably wouldnt want to
you get variety visas like permanent residency country aims facilitate spouses nationals especially retirees proven cash bank however youll become citizen various rights enjoy
its also worth noting might get permanent residence youll never one even live  years always foreigner viewed locals pros cons youll never quite feel home accepted one group
youll get undue respect westerner forget talking politics leveling criticisms way things doneyoull met hostility resentment latter
 weather asia  sunshine 
the weather south east asia generally pretty awesome live outdoors life youll truly enjoy youre type
the sun shines almost every day even overcast warm meaning go anything walk beach shop city
however storms come youd better prepared get ass inside rainfall wind many countries south east asia truly terrifying switch news station next time major storm hits philippines youll see like
thankfully  years living philippines  ive never caught directly major storm although ive seen tail end plenty them
the weather good good utterly awful bad check clip see bad get

 asia  years behind west terms development 
this stereotype thats deeply mistaken whether true depends country go to
