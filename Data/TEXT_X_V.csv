posted friday october   edt 
keywords fallout  nuclear  nuclear attack  nuclear attack survival  nuclear bomb  nuclear bomb survival  nuclear power  nuclear radiation  nuclear war  nuke  radiation  survival  tactical nuke ongoing tensions united states russia fears nuclear world war  breaking running alltime high 
with mind thought needful write article survive aftermath nuclear fallout obviously could discuss likelihood event occurring isnt within scope article personally believe point time scenario far fetched however situation fluid thus things could change time 
basically theres two main types nuclear weapons first youve got known tactical nukes intercontinental sort  stuff would basically flatten earth case theres point even trying survive im going talking survive tactical nuke incident  dont anywhere near ground zero 
obviously first step surviving initial explosion first place course theres ton happen wrong place wrong time youve got hope exit world pretty quick  would certainly happen youre anywhere close ground zero 
the tremendous heat sheer force explosion enough kill anyone flatten anything within  km radius detonation site intense thermal radiation emitted flash light detonation enough blind burn flesh start fires impact zone 
if youre outside happens happen survive take immediate cover building get debris wash soap water soon possible 
as survivor initial explosion around   minutes bail area lethal amount radiation fallout comes mushroom cloud  minutes need get least  km  mile blast zone survive fallout however within  hours lethal radiation spread prevailing winds keep moving safety feel wind begin running perpendicular  upwind downwind  getting shelter 
if cant get ground zero whatever reason need get shelter soon possible get deepest underground basement find highest story th level possible 
if fallout zone safely sheltered need remain least  days time food water carefully rationed clothing layered prevent radiation 
really best way survive nuclear event prepare one 
remember nuclear fallout shelters cold war era well thats need inside survive shelter got meet number different specifications going go find plenty information google build nuclear fallout shelter etc  personal protection measures 
protecting body harmful radiation fallout particles number one priority getting shelter 
like said prepared prior event important good idea carry gear im going talk shortly inside go bag keep car house workplace 
some quick first aid tips necessary wounds covered prevent contamination entry radioactive particles burns caused radiation must first washed normal burn first aid procedure followed 
now lets look gear ready nuclear attack happens 
gas mask youll need gas mask protect face respiratory system airborne pathogens chemical particles israeli military surplus gas masks fitted nato  mm cbrn filters best cheapest around yet getting harder harder find days huge supplies flying shelves relatively recent ebola scar civilian version gas mask extremely comfortable port hydration tube best tested real life conditions middle east 
military chemical suit suits provide optimal protection chemical biological attacks used british army surprisingly cheap yet proven work soldiers whose lives depend everyday combat situations get around  amazoncom 
gloves youre going need gloves protect hands contact chemical pathogens biological particles long chemical resistant gloves found online supermarkets hardware stores get around    depending brand etc 
boots order full protection chemical biological hazards important good pair rubber overboots protect feet legs chemical biological particles coming contact body ensure blouse trousers inside boots maximum protection boots recommend used uk military get amazoncom around  
nuclear protection way reduce effects nuclear radiation body called potassium iodide available amazon less  pack  tablets basically reduces chances harmful radioactive iodine entering thyroid glands 
if dont nuclear attack happens improvise mentioned clothing layered prevent radiation contact skin cover eyes closefitting sunglasses improvised goggles 
 decontaminating food water 
water food contaminated debris nuclear fallout making procurement consumption difficult however impossible make safe consume 
whenever possible try use water sealed container bottle safely assume water inside sealed container contaminated wash container thoroughly soap water boil least  minutes breaking seal water sealed containers available next choice emergency conditions water springs boil water least  minutes drinking keep water covered boiling prevent contamination airborne pathogens 
your last choice extreme emergency sealed water spring water unavailable use standing water found small pools ponds basically water flow contaminants microorganisms germs survive easily stagnant water first boil water long practical kill organisms next filter cloth remove nasties 
in cases mentioned use water purification tablets following directions bottlepackaging boiling initial filtration prior consumption 
like water also assume sealed containers packages processed food safe ensure safety decontaminate food containers washing soap water boiling container water  minutes helps decent supply sealed buckets containers militarystyle mres freezedried foods wise foods mountain house 
you consider supplementing sealed rations local plants animals produce extreme emergencies unfortunately matter prepare decontaminate food guarantee cooking kill biological agents 
remember survive long time without food least  weeks longer especially food eat may potentially kill 
if must use local food select healthylooking plants animals fruit vegetables select known carriers organisms rats vermin always use gloves protective clothing handling dressing animals plants etc cook plant animal food boiling boil food least  minutes kill pathogens try fry bake roast local food guarantee infected portions reached required temperature kill pathogens eat raw food costs 
obviously article nowhere near comprehensive hope gives idea need order survive aftermath nuclear attack hope pray event happen peace prevail planet might also like"

dr david duke offers new paradigm humanity read listen amazing statement create revolution concept human rights recognition absolute right every people preserve human diversity independence freedom right every people preserve culture traditions art forms characteristics society 
a path peace harmonious nations societies must resist globalist destruction freedom globalist forms economic financial slavery globalist zionist wars 
in power reason love understanding declaration human diversity freedom moral engine saving european heritage truly rights every people earth foundation human freedom 
i believe us must committed preservation human diversity cherish value every form life earth call biodiversity also respect honor diversity mankind believe every people right preserve expression humanity heritage culture every people earth right rule right free independent 
human freedom principle peoples must free different humanity one many destroying variety diversity freedom diverse humanity destruction humanity 
not recognizing inborn urge every people express essence forms art music culture religion societal structure government leads human conflict often violence human suffering horrific scale 
much worlds conflicts peoples cultures different allowed different globalists imperialists seek expand empires want control resources economy nations destroy real human diversity human differences values cultures economies religions freedom independence preserve celebrated differences stand way globalists want regiment mankind make soulless consumers human diversity natural 
human life expressed multitude diverse peoples created geographic social adaption course thousands years whether celebrate human diversity handiwork nature religious sense creation god celebrate rich tapestry different peoples cultures across earth 
we believe every people culture right preserve unique expression humanity every people right maintain enrich unique culture nurture particular expressions art music literature philosophies architecture religion diet traditions values make every people unique add beauty possibility mankind 
we believe every people right politically free independent ruled exploited people nation reject globalist power seeks destroy independence freedom every people destroy human diversity every people must right self preservation freedom 
we believe every free people right live harmonious society created image nature spirit 
for example people tibet human right live society oriented heritage culture tradition nation peoples today tibetan people threatened massive nontibetan immigration forced imperial power meant marginalize heritage culture tibetan people homeland loss unique people culture tibet horrific loss truly loss humanity true tibet tibetan people true every people earth believe people tibet every nation right defend borders inherent human right preserve unique ethnic cultural character freedom independence 
nations similar cultural ethnic religious social traditions tend far harmonious wracked internal cultural ethnic religious divisions 
we also affirm states significant ethnic cultural minorities tend happy peaceful cooperative group freedom autonomy makes group feel home society 
if one looks honestly world quickly recognizes greatest source civil conflict hatreds wars genocide horrific human rights violations comes ethnic conflict often accompanied religious conflict happens like putting fuse dynamite 
it truism want reduce ethnic conflict must endeavor give every people human right live create society community values every group respect right every group 
we believe endemic conflicts rooted supranational states globalist denial reality human diversity denial natural human desire people live society reflecting heritage traditions culture values one size fit 
instead recognizing reality globalists empire builders seek destroy distinctions humanity become compliant control exploitation instead accepting reality human nature truly diversity life including human life globalists continue promote destructive policies destroy harmony traditional societies historical character nations massive immigration diverse peoples another peoples living space produces conflict harmony 
we believe massive forced immigration nonindigenous people peoples lands almost always indigenous people 
and leads civil repression conflict hatreds violence one look much palestinian nakba massive immigration tibet examples universal truth reality true europe areas world undergone massive immigration regions nation states 
look riots deep social unrest conflict befallen traditional harmonious societies experienced massive unwanted immigration 
a world independent cultures true diversity freedom 
a multicultural state contribute human diversity contribute human happiness peace harmony often lessens human love human rights matter high motive produces disharmony harmony discord accord 
just natural world every life form needs living space needs preservation ecosystem survive flourish true every people humanity 
every people needs living space ecocultural system thrive ignoring reality leads conflict diverse human peoples cultures religions competing limited living space greatest single cause civil war crimes humanity 
united nations studies show ethnic cultural religious conflicts within nations primary engines civil conflict war takes enormous toll human suffering numbering hundreds millions dead injured dispossessed human beings 
this urge diversity always mankind always recognize elemental part mankinds nature progenitor conflict 
in fact rise idea people right free ethnic conflict increasing imperial states created conquest longer repress desire diverse people freedom ethnic expression 
nations whose rulers established immigration policies ignoring human differences increasingly divided conflicted trying change natural urge toward freedom like screaming tide 
the global elite government media huge stake trying regiment worlds populations tell us endeavor destroy every unique culture human expression  
they attempt change human nature history increasingly conflicted world show like screaming tide 
better recognize human nature within context support national regional freedom lessons conflict supports mutual respect 
it time teach new ethic recognizes human right every people exist thrive however seek peoples freedom must understand rights must afforded every people effort toward worthy goal must spirit destroying rights others peaceful resolution conflicts 
it far better recognize realities inherent desires humanity avoid much human conflict possible try destroy human distinctions pursuit imperialist empire globalist regimentation conformity even destruction peoples based utopian vision goes basic human nature ultimately leads dreamed peace love people conflict hate attempts control exploit harm people crime humanity 
we must condemn violence harming destruction people must adopt clear human ethic attempts control exploit nation people crime humanity 
we support human freedom support human diversity support right every people nation society support supremacism control repression people efforts control exploit crime humanity 
as person european descent see much repressive globalism damaging world originates mostly european peopled nations today called west see globalism damages harms worlds diversity peoples harms people learned must allow exploitation heritage committed well humanity 
this lifechanging lesson learned life young man joined nonviolent klan organization community like many young people across world longed identify people defend heritage love believed threatened 
but still young man left organization came realize moral right speak human rights people unless embrace idea human rights every people must committed securing human rights war violence human suppression power human ideas ideals 
i believe vast majority earths people believe principles set forth life realized peoples desires peoples heritage rights mine 
i realize fully context genuine commitment respect rights freedoms humanity one morally campaign peoples fundamental rights defending diversity humanity defense humanity 
there nothing wrong people defending rights heritage fact defending preserving diversity humanity defense humanity 
but must come genuine concern rights heritage 
in context understanding move toward peaceful resolutions social religious ethnic conflicts time preserve heritage diversity freedom humanity 
nations overwhelmingly unifying heritage culture religious social tradition right preserve expression humanity societal harmony 
it crime destroy values pursuit socalled multiculturalism one wants see massive immigration alien peoples cultures religions lead look happened warravaged dismembered nation called yugoslavia look cultural ethnic genocide tibet look tribal religious conflicts many nations mideast 
group differences run deep even though muslim quran repeatedly teaches muslim unity still extremist elements shiites sunnis blow children others holy places worship admonitions jesus christ violence love reconciliation stop irish catholics scottishderived protestants cascade violence lead death countless innocents 
although understand historical motives mass immigration one people another peoples lands must continue repeat mistakes modern world create divided strifetorn communities regions nations models self rule societal harmony 
and majority human right live social fabric harmony history values minorities must accorded human right communities regions reflect essence helped migrate sovereign region compatriots 
this human freedom human rights fundamental level nations significant minorities diverse people strive toward recognizing desire freedom self expression 
autonomy within nations german language speaking south tyrol region north italy italian french germanspeaking cantons switzerland offer models recognition differences language heritage ethnicity liberal degree autonomy lead peaceful national fabric 
nation states seek imperial power conquering subjection peoples coming apart seams inherent freedom identity grow suppressed people 
even european nations divided slight differences history identity genetics culture seek freedom artificially created nation czechoslovakia composed czechs slovaks held together  years intense totalitarian physical suppression propaganda conditioning 
when communist tyranny collapsed used new freedom create independent states czech republic slovak republic 
they mutual respect war without horrific crimes humanity 
contrast artificially created state yugoslavia created name empire held together ruthless authoritarian regime communism fell people wedded old ideas empire tried desperately hold control vast areas diverse peoples result long war brutality massive crimes humanity occurred sides conflict 
how much better parties conflict embraced ethic people right self rule self expression regions take example two many peoples trapped old yugoslavia serbians croatians even though serbians may dominated government yugoslavia effectively control peoples totalitarian state must suppress natural differences people force regimentation conformity 
so even serbian people lost unique identity well peoples ruled people warmly embrace right serbians croatians rule globalism continuation yugoslavian totalitarianism global scale 
ironically serbians croatians indeed us face globalist tyrants demanding control economy serbia croatia currencies controlled new york london rather people increasingly subject media controlled hollywood new york rather spirit traditional heritage values 
and height insanity globalists eyeing mass immigration serbia croatia massive numbers noneuropean immigrants far fundamentally different serbs croats prescription future human conflict rights majorities minorities 
there many harmonious nations earth overwhelmingly one primary heritage minor differences among inhabitants 
but nations corrupted globalist power media elite propagandized humanity one many go peoples usher massive immigration alien population 
this process almost always democratic nations inhabitants history repeatedly shows numbers increase societal differences conflicts discord increase globalists resort old totalitarian tactics suppressing free speech free association kinds human liberty even point forbidding public displays traditional culture vast majority 
a powerful example american government made illegal display christian christmas motif public ground even overwhelmingly christian cultural nation america supposedly created e pluribus unum many one dominated identity ethnic politics 
the powerful lobby american politics far instance jewish lobby comprised ethnic group two percent american people driven ethnic religious supremacism jewish organizations lead fight destruction christian christmas traditions 
the political landscape america dominated special interest groups every politician must bow except course european american majority must silently watch cultural traditions christmas destroyed course goes far beyond christmas americans experiencing increasing identity politics division generated massive illegal immigration rights small nations cannot sacrificed 
on international level must recognized crime humanity imperial state occupy another peoples lands exploitation labor resources autonomy independent regions possible degree autonomy certainly possible significant groups area community institutions schools structures oriented toward needs spirit 
it time stand freedom peoples time stand globalist destruction biodiversity destruction human diversity destruction earths indigenous cultures artistic expressions lifestyles traditions independence zionist globalism actually supremacism 
the globalists seek destruction every unique expression humanity want destroy unique character people every people earth 
they seek destroy human diversity earth easily rule us market brands junk movies media music want us consume junk food world agribusiness media advertises destroys planets ecosystems destroys health health hundreds millions people spawning epidemics obesity heart disease diabetes ills

of course trump wont power day election day wait inauguration day clean potential messes barack hussein obama likely give racial hate groups green light media whips collective stradivarius plays heart bleeds thee sympathizes devils destroying nation
if bitch wins conservative groups may clash leftists rights stripped away
if hillary wins theres real possibility protests day election social conditioning whites polite docile even theyre railroaded formerly nation may hold time around hillary win means chaos possibly violence could wait starts stripping constitutional rights away likely see conservatives finally come start raising righteous hell could racially motivated clashes horizon white people standing goes longestablished narrative theyre evil racists
few people think effects civil unrest could livelihood wellbeing time little education thinly stretched american supply chain could happen shortterm disruption it
heres scenario  one many possible scenarios video rioters stopping looting semi tractortrailer charlotte worrying trucks stop america stops attacks truckers happen often enough truckers may decide worth risk lives continue moving freight around stop driving within day bedlam could ensue supply chain runs razors edge modern america everything food medication gasoline starts running out
supply chain rioters broke trucks burned cargo charlotte
according american trucking association ata disruption   hours means hospitals nursing homes would run food fuel supplies gas stations would also run time frame garbage would start pile grocery retail stores would start run food merchandise atm bank cash supplies would also run out
the tight rope corporate system walks quickly breaks merchandise stops moving
as example ata tells us happens hurricane imagine would happen days weeks rioting major cities
in hurricane situation supplies would normally last days water powdered milk canned meat typically disappear within one day given inventory rates means perishable goods could depleted matter days nonperishables days runs food nonfood staples hurricanes even big winter storms provide good example fast retail inventories depleted panic buying quick depletion inventories could occur trucks stopped making deliveries reason
panic buying means food shelves people dont food home grocery store doesnt food rioting intensify things could get ugly hurry one small disruption leads domino effect bedlam ensues
so best prepared nonperishable items case things get hand least several weeks food supply hand stop people coming taking stash
be armed police wont around protect bedlam ensues
contrary gun propaganda media  absolutely want armed event election aftermath dont pass peacefully happens stores longer food gas stations longer gas gangs form looking homes items
theyre going pick weakest home neighborhood pounce
a home guns safe home youtube video shows  armed thugs may bust house looking money food started jumping plate glass windows scrambling like cockroaches homeowner came guns blazing
several handguns extra ammunition advised know use steady trigger dont afraid use looters come house
the police protect theyll hands full chaos
better safe sorry idea intact nuclear family may trite memory protecting loved ones still key
with meltdown america happening right eyes entering unstable period nations history say least matter wins election nation knew loved passing away trump may able turn things around temporarily even country many immigrants impossible assimilate all

1682,"disclaimer legal advice charged criminal offense think may contact attorney 
if western man  world view comes sex forged era internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content political climate anything goes sexual identity virtually age could forgiven thinking first sex sweetheart back high school earlier wasnt something remarkable youve probably forgotten years later could also one accusation away defending sex offense case
while american culture evolved many fairly convincingly argue de volved sexually open environment societal legal restrictions beyond involving children animals statutory rape still caught complex patchwork state based laws
federal law stipulate universal age consent instead leaving states codify though safe everywhere north america avoiding girls  may think thats law land federal statutes principally refer matters surrounding pornographic material prostitution wayyou didnt take naked selfies make homemade porno right good thing didnt could violated federal law pornography 
what age consent america wouldnt even trust fake id
the age private consensual sexual acts america ranges    sometimes lower case married couples even lower foreign countries way say youre american student overseas foreign girlfriend whos legal country still might want check knowledgable lawyer getting dirty
why significant starters un convention rights child considers anyone age  child magic number also used prosecute anyone going overseas intent sex minor us law area aimed pedophiles traffickers theres reason could applied young man trip cancun studying abroad eastern europe likely situation young american male domestic however
dont take one team
for example back  girlfriend  age consent state  might well aware done several timesperhaps even knowledge approval parents may stayed years eventually got married likely parted ways havent looked back since
till one day get knock door policeman wants question relationship years earlier thinking nothing tell basic details admitting sexual contact bam arrested statutory rape minor defense consenting multiple times even know underage irrelevantas minor cannot consent may say whether press charges
the long arm law may reach 
well thats bother since long ago statute limitations passed anyway right fast first amassed assets years later could still decide sue civil court damages although always successful  either win trial eke monetary settlement even absent criminal conviction civil court judgement pay settlement sex assault related case something man wants resume ask bill clinton 
moreover beyond statute limitations prosecuting assume clear statutes limitations changed  including accused offenders even though previously beyond statute limitations statements may made law enforcement happens would fair game
while intent changes laws noblethey want nail child abusers got away decadesthe reality get scooped mix teenager sexual encounter kind underage girl perhaps even underage think engaged situation could charged best course action clam consult lawyer jurisdiction
this applies even one day approached anyone blue bring subject even though youd nearly forgotten get arrested charged prosecuting attorney decides prosecute continue keep quiet regardless prosecutors come go replacement political agenda could perhaps decide reopen case pursue charges
branded life 
if get charged miracle able cop plea get probation jail time probably still wind sex offender registry  perhaps life say get luckier still serious doubts surface veracity story eventually charges reduced dropped completely resulting conviction sex offender registry requirement well guess still arrest record sex offense rap sheetit matters conviction
imagine driving road years later cop drives behind automatically scans license plate common practice sex offense arrest pops think stand good chance getting pulled scrutiny chances youre going away warning instead ticket day better worse cop instinct view arrests would conviction best keep arrests completely life much possible
you get breaks watch stfu yes course knew back prom night yes know grown women teachers sex minors often convicted trial still receive jail sentences  sir heterosexual man acting urges therefore prime targetdoubly youre white nonislamic attending college boarding school particularly prestigious institution  forewarned forearmed
young men need well aware laws state engaging sexual contact situations could face statutory rape accusation youve got story two back glory days high school quarterback freshman cheerleader dont tell story anyone ever political climate favorable youand could stay way absent much needed reality check

heres comeys letter senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks public shouldnt know person may voting investigated fbi 
thats absurd thing heard quite time considering election thats really saying something 
this new yorker report emphasis mine

oh ill bet 
ill bet trump target investigation would stage gripping podium stay upright  saying wonderful comey decided break news voters could aware might voting someone suspected broken federal laws ill bet shed saying public right know candidate investigation ill bet shed take high road say elected office president united states beyond reproach 
of course things little different arent 
we right know absolutely right know person could elected know secrets careless knew secrets seems like nobrainer public know candidate investigated second time criminally negligent information entrusted 
and fact know severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls incredibly skewed point outright fake  looks like mainstream trying save face new batch polls poll abc news washington post  hotbeds liberal voters shown lead dropped within single point donald trump due clinton email scandal 
about third likely voters say theyre less likely support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday bureau investigating emails related probe clintons use private email server secretary state  
finally people actually paying attention character hillary clinton 
but may enough one finding astonishing even though probably shouldnt 
given considerations  percent say makes difference 
meanwhile social media fbi emails somehow trending topic certainly appears twitter facebook snapchat buzzfeed blacking topic biggest question 
why james comey probably committed career suicide along potential actual suicide via shot back head like others run afoul clintons feel need break news particularly giving pass last investigation 
opponents jump fact hes republican say political reasons 
they wont admit perhaps felt guilty complicit letting hook first investigation clinton email negligence 
they never ever admit maybe integrity belief office holds made impossible keep quiet election perhaps given chance right previous wrong took clinton isnt taking gracefully

first trump everyone loves trump trump hillary therefore must better argument based following stalin killed  million one mao killed  million two stalin better mao trump outright lets go back sleep candidate hillary already seen heard enough trump goes least four years bought nation survive juts four years 
from called militia patriots awrm intelligence report yammer trump goes postpone coming war buy time prepare claim time favors us enemy bearing mind trump gone back word many times changed mind flip flopped illegals wants bigger police state hated media etc lets compare next runner quickly 
hillary currently chic hate hillary youre style like end nation doom world never mind trump hillary put nwo allowed run otherwise old news going cause war liar cheat betrayed nation etc yet trump met netanyahu behind closed doors apparently received blessing proceed trap know see clearly also darling media 
both common rise power theme lenin hitler take two nations germany russia collapse outright collapsed debauchery rule well corruption hillary like lenin going red banners flying cheka heels remove undesirables going finish job push agenda hilt even takes war trump hand following hitlers script offering hope without promising anything except bigger government powerful police state etc trump also see plan fruition subtle nuance two one offering iron fist velvet glove simply iron fist 
now comes problem people seeing force hillary despite public outrage know fact reached level preparation adequate dealing public backlash even insurrection minor full put trump taking back street approach gathered resources yet put us need put someone quiet public like obama time election purchasing time nothing nothing less 
if trump put already see going straight back bed getting another four years minimum maybe eight militias patriot groups declare partial victory bury guns whistle dixie mortified take action trump obvious choice hillary hand represents steamroller coming hill full tilt want seek avoid rather fight reality time favor us time favors enemy time favored us would diminished dire straits imagine much could avoided militia stood waco time favored enemy ruby ridge time favored enemy whittle away build power base bit bit fools

even within administration confusion whether payment fact ransom state department spokesman mark toner came close acknowledging fact noted  million used leverage ensure americans safe return white house however quickly repudiated state departments characterization 
even one believe story peddled administration mere appearance quid pro quo payment potentially exposes us extortion hostagetaking iranians certainly believed ransom payment likely every twobit dictator planet saw way well 
but deeper troubling aspects convoluted story january   address american people obama tried put positive spin dealings islamic republic noted rick richman excellent article featured mosaic  deal struck iranians rotten core administration deliberately kept american people dark various aspects shady arrangement 
the  million us transferred iran came irans foreign military sales fms account pentagon balance  billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since  obama neglected note iran filed lawsuit us filed counterclaim iran  million iranian breaches obligations fms program us could conceivably counterclaim would meant wooden pallets cash american treasury courtesy islamic republic

some plaintiffs sought recover judgments directly irans fms account efforts stymied clinton administration instead convoluted deal struck congress clinton administration  us treasury pay holders judgments iran amount compensatory damages  percent punitive damages amount fms fund judgments would subrogated united states meant judgments became direct us claims iranian government 
iran ignored judgments never paid plaintiffs us law  million sitting fms account gone back us treasury already paid judgment holders us treasury never collected dime subrogated claims since obama shipped money wooden pallets iran essentially us taxpayer ended footing bill irans terrorism iranians never held accountable maleficence 
obamas actions represented blatant disregard law victims terrorism american taxpayer claim saving taxpayer billions represents zenith mendacity 
obama claimed payments made cash existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures noted richman sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made settle iranian claims instituted hague exposing yet another lie obama administration 
there one one reason iranians requested cash disingenuous know reason iranians worlds foremost statesponsors international terrorism finance terrorist groups proxy militias throughout region internationally illicit means circumvent normal methods financing hence demanded untraceable cash misery currently witnessing syria yemen elsewhere due small part obama administration provided iranians cash necessary keep operations flowing 
in addition  billion cash obama also authorized release seven convicted iranian felons expunged warrants  others aspect transaction seems almost trivial considering sheer mendacity illegality nearly every aspect deal 
lastly transfer large sum iran settlement alleged legal claim required attorney generals approval administration yet produce document bearing loretta lynchs signature authorizing payment october  sen marco rubio r fla rep mike pompeo r kan presented lynch series questions seeking clarification various aspects deal lynch whose tenure attorney general proving corrupt partisan predecessor inexplicably refused answer lawmakers queries 
in desperate attempt establish legacy obama pursued iran deal reckless abandon forfeiting positions previously regarded red lines signing worst deal us diplomatic history ancillary deal struck iranians concerning american hostages laced outright lies enabled iranians continue reign regional terror importantly may also violation existing us law lynchs stonewalling lends credence notion"

secondly policy changes ignore unique nature sharing economy sites like airbnb accommodation providers often accepting guests literal homes sole investment property whereas hotels roundtheclock staff including security airbnb properties much informal unsupervised providers therefore good reasons judicious exactly let residences airbnbs open doors policy treats discrimination complaint gospel truth brian chesky mustve drank poisoned water fellow tech sjw jack dorsey twitter

as antitrump rallies continue rage across nation new york city philadelphia michigan media completely ignores assaults occurring trump voters

despite elites attempts destroy us fact winning battle reasons simple
truth always powerful falsehood numerous effectively silenced dont congregate one single platform collection individuals based around ideology high energy decisive assertive confident men would like offer supporters causes signs hope victory near trump going lead way

 grubhub crash 
after matt maloney ceo online food delivery service grubhub proclaimed email agree trumps politics resign stock dropped nearly  days
since time addition companys stock tanking received ample backlash sites manner twitter facebook reddit independent blogs major altright news centers
this fellow rok contributors manosphere bloggers talking mentioned tangible impact trump voters hillarys supporters lack characteristics necessary make change
a burning passion sense purpose moral fortitude sense justice selfconfidence courage stand rights fucking spine win period antitrump crowd based around massive entitlement complex victim complex thinking blind social sheep people like ever political financial power world
of course think hard working businessmen entrepreneurs people investing stock market order take control financial future hard working intelligent men dont make excuses obviously know types men voted donald trump
why think dow jones industrial average time high trumps win restored faith america
 rise new media 
the mainstream media repeatedly shown completely incompetent regards actually reporting issues nothing puppet show meant distract entertain brainwash american public
they consistently lied candidates manipulated evidence falsified facts skewed statistics polls defamed multiple individuals mere political opinion happen longer
with rise new media men begun establishing outlets across platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope list goes on
i firmly believe next eight years looked back historians one important times humanitys time earth 
america brought world stability stood symbol ideal countries follow monolith free speech bravery economic prosperityand elites tried destroy satisfy greedy little egos
the men america past  years cough obamas presidency cough seen exponential increase quantity alternative news outlets also quality
sites merely blogs years ago evolved fullblown news syndicates live reporting onsite video footage actual news anchors literally people fighting back want freedom speech it
while mainstream media draws final breath theyre proclaiming theres new radical whitenationalist group called altright attempt make us look like evil fascists fact somebody threaten kill twitter  banned course not
this repeated favoring violent mentally ill leftists makes clear msms agenda istotal control complete suppression freedoms speech sorry alternative media isnt going let happen
 massive boycotts antitrump companies 
the lefts hypocrisy never ceases amaze somehow completely legally destroy independent family owned business simply refusing bake gay couple cake trump supporters simply boycott multibillion dollar conglomerate ones hateful

again actions signify trump supporters power assertiveness courage willingness take action donald trump wonhis supporters grown ups little babies want safe spaces antifree speech zones
when donald trumps voters get oppressed biased controlled media elite globalists dont whine cry something protest stop supporting companies shipping jobs away speak logical rational way anger hatred left towards white men
they take lives hands rather relying stupid system caters cry babies whiners take health hands take finances hands take relationships hands
they dont wait around someone else themthey get done trump got office going make america great again

it would grave mistake understate amount damage done us economy past eight years article going share economic numbers extremely sobering anyone takes cold hard honest look numbers able see economy terrible shape unfortunately way see things often clouded political views election democrats far likely republicans believe economy improving process completely reversing according gallup   percent republicans believed economy getting better election number suddenly jumped  percent trumps election victory percentage democrats believe economy getting better fell  percent  percent election additional details gallup  
after trump last weeks election republicans republicanleaning independents much optimistic view us economys outlook    republicans said economy getting better week election  said getting worse since election  say getting better  worse 
conversely democrats democraticleaning independents confidence economy plummeted election election  democrats said economy getting better  worse democrats evenly divided  saying getting better  saying getting worse 
the truth course result election somehow magically alter outlook us economy 
we still giant mess hands following  depressing economic realities donald trump inherit barack obama 
 nearly  every  americans less  savings  means twothirds country essentially living paycheck paycheck moment 
 reuters reporting us mall investors poised lose billions dollars  retail apocalypse  nation deepens 
 credit card delinquencies hit highest level seen since   
 approximately  percent americans debt least  days past due 
 rate homeownership fallen eight years row hovering near  year low  
 total number government employees outnumbers total number manufacturing employees country almost  million  
 number homeless people new york city donald trump hit brand new record high  
  percent young adults currently living parents  
 total household debt united states reached grand total  trillion dollars  
 total amount corporate debt us nearly doubled since end  
 barack obama entered white house us government  trillion dollars debt today us national debt currently sitting staggering total   
despite nearly doubling national debt eight years white house barack obama going president united states history never single year us gdp grew least three percent 
so donald trump waltz suddenly turn everything around 
just like george w bush elected lot optimism future right among republicans 
and  republicans going control senate house addition control white house 
but mean actually get anything done 
for moment lets review didnt happen last time republicans position following extended excerpt article author devvy kidd   republicans control houses congress part time bush jrs two terms lock borders pass legislation stop funding illegals would selfdeport millions liars cheats thieves read please selfdeport millions illegals  stop trillions unconstitutional spending get rid clintons unconstitutional executive orders one two otherwise let comrade bill clinton crap faces get rid one unconstitutional cabinet like hhs department education epa stop unconstitutional foreign aid stop unconstitutional spending planned parenthood congress continues use borrowed money spend debt stop unconstitutional spending gigantic hoax called global warming climate change trump left lost war climate change bush jr get us destructive trade treaties killing american jobs crack visas bringing tens thousands foreign workers american workers want work left unemployment line stop federal regulations strangling americas businesses impeach one single activist judge destroying freedom liberty republican controlled congress republican white house virtually nothing restore america constitutional republic constitutional spending  
so things different trump administration 
we shall see 
there tremendous pressure maintain status quo many instances process fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse shortterm 
a great example national debt discussed yesterday  reason able enjoy massively inflated standard living country     federal government started spending money brought taxes ridiculous debt  would begin collapsing immediately 
we consume far wealth produce way able borrowing insane amounts money 
either donald trump continue borrow money recklessly go major league economic downturn 
it really simple 
but politicians borrow money literally destroying future country choice pain shortterm greater pain longterm 
there way would involve shutting federal reserve going completely debtfree form money topic another article 
and unfortunately something even donald trumps radar point 
no matter election next president going faced harsh economic realities 
there many faith donald trump pull unprecedented economic miracle others deeply skeptical

1145,"war payday lending apple uses similar tactics iphone jonathan lee  misesorg  october   comments image credits flickr khrawlings  
in june  consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward proposal regulate shortterm loan industry 
the small dollar lending rule seeks alleviate solve apparent weaknesses current rates shortterm lenders requiring lenders assess verify borrowers income housing costs credit legal obligations 
the intention proposal protect lowincome families caught endless cycle many forced take another loan make ends meet first glance seems rule would solve problems industry known dirtiness except policymakers thinking hearts sitting airconditioned offices away facts form interaction real world shortterm loans fact see shortterm loan industry dirty supplies sufficient reason believe either policymakers ignorantly prejudiced plainly manipulative 
instead pointing fingers name calling shortterm lending industry applying simple economics proposals see hold water 
in understanding cfpb proposal payday small loans paper released cfpb pew charitable trusts bureau aimed make several arguments favor new legislation 
the first arguments payday vehicle title loan markets lenders borrowers interests aligned profitability lenders depends loans unaffordable customers doesnt argument stand industry sells product 
for example interests iphone sellers buyers aligned manner acceptable cfpb additional iphone  said cost  produce sold  dollars  times cost make borrow phrase left thats pricegouging tune  percent yet noise policymakers claiming call apple company cheats customers 
so shortterm lenders held accountable way different apple shouldnt shortterm lenders able charge interest rates makeup huge risk incur lending money lowincome borrowers 
studies show lenders charge average  percent  every  loaned  profit margin significantly less price percentage difference products markets 
the second cfpbs arguments solve balloon payments cycle continued borrowing pay loans cfpb would require products become installment loans smaller manageable payments 
the problem statement bureau completely ignores reason shortterm loans available borrowers  shortterm loan companies offset risk requiring borrowers weigh risk need borrow 
simply put short payment periods put place deter definitely borrow additionally making periods longer payments smaller defeats business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant models defined expediency 
the third cfpbs arguments proposal would solve problems related price gouge lending requiring lenders evaluate borrowers financial condition forcing borrowers submit written statements income housing expenses outstanding debt child support meanwhile lender required obtain national credit report deliver data proposed credit tracking agencies 
remember governmentimposed requirements cost shortterm lenders money cost finding data would eliminate ability firms loan small amounts cash current interest rates result would either lead shortterm loan companies shut hurt borrowers requiring borrow larger sums money qualify loans 
lastly cfpb heralds redesign prompted study pew charitable trusts survey research vast majority borrowers want  products become installment loans smaller manageable payments 
at first glance seems borrowers need hurting want find way difficult situation although caught inability pay back loans got caught bad finance due risk shortterm loans many surveyed actually sent raving reviews support shortterm loans 
in fact  percent  submissions bureaus  tell story  program  people sent experiences regarding shortterm loans  positive excessively thankful loans 
these responses ranged avenues lend money like simple thank study personally conducted cfpb unsatisfied results hid publics view freedom information act request forced release 
this holding back information demonstrates bureau truly searching help people says wants help rather keen eye policy symbolism flash fighting underdog fact irreversibly harming sticking knife back 
policymakers continue belief shortterm loans bad seem comes either attend economics classes college simply want perceived someone cares cannot let policymakers make decisions hearts lead make uneducated proposals cannot let legislators sway hearts hear extreme situations people hurt instead need look coldhard facts numbers cfpb uses defend arguments manipulative outright false 
the small dollar lending rule must allowed pass proposal must removed taken back  hurt people claims help let americans make decisions  theyre smarter riskaverse washington insiders give credit

shortly hillary clintons crushing defeat media came another spin zuckerberg facebook held responsible debacle crap facebook apparently carried fake news didnt media invent promote precisely kind news bounce hillary last hurdle convenient media whores blame everybody except hillarys corrupt campaign organization defeat clinton labeled ordinary americans deplorables displaying contempt half population hillary clinton favorite puppet establishment embodiment hopelessly corrupt political system american people realized despite massive attempts media presstitutes sell image estimated  per cent media outlets beat drums husbands corrupt clinton foundation
the real reason behind attempt blame zuckerbergs facebook makes everyone one responsible posted facebook longer controlled media political class lost control public opinion established methods mindcontrol work longer fawning media report fed government spindoctors comfortable act like mouthpieces masters holds true us media well media class european vassal states german media example manipulative united states celebrated president obama embodiment good america ignoring waged wars entire presidency incarcerated several whistleblowers signed extralegal executions possessed great advantage black wish nonwhite obama thus nonwhite smarter version george w bush

there agreed upon definition hate speech implies hence meaning volatile arbitrarily range hate speech range antimuslim rhetoric via personal insults threats call kill every jewish zionist duty government international convention abolition forms racial discrimination prohibit dissemination racial propaganda ergo exists legal ethical basis prohibiting certain forms hate speech
even restrictions free speech extend spheres prohibition deceitful advertising slandering people countries advertising tobacco alcohol forbidden iceland human rights law accepts right governments restrict freedom speech order protect social values great deal jurisprudence regarding question weigh right rights
in germany body private detectives includes civil society groups klicksafede jugendschutznet gesicht zeigen show face name eminent amadeu antonio foundation run former stasi agent name anetta kahane claims fight racism antisemitism xenophobia today organization forefront criticizing people dare criticize excesses merkels policy government failure
internet giants facebook google youtube twitter also participated voluntarily constitutive meeting kind internet watchdog set september  new censorship body established german ministry justice works since without legal basis participants agreed best practices handling hate messages publically known criteria according one recognize hate speach means censorship body makes decisions arbitrarily rules statutory provisions whose messages blocked thus legal recourse censorship despite arbitrary practice interim results presented ministry justice  september  satisfactory google youtube facebook representatives participated presentation results august september  punishable contents reported deleted companies nevertheless ministry justice satisfied
thus american political class blaming facebook defeat minion hillary clinton also german political class compliant media intend crack facebook fearing ordinary people could endanger merkels quest renewed mandate chancellor appears important desperate attempt control public opinion deplorables ie mass ordinary people anymore wish bamboozled half dozen editorsinchief attempt free control crushed help facebook google

i realize headline must sound extremely bizarre article explain could actually happen learned fbi obtained search warrant enable agency examine approximately  emails sitting electronic devices owned huma abedin estranged husband anthony weiner fbi going emails unlikely still possible decision whether charge hillary clinton crime could made november th course likely scenario hillary clinton indicted election day americans voting scandal hanging ominously clinton campaign fbi quickly take action possible hillary clinton could forced race election day would require democrats come new candidate 
in fact already calls mainstream media clinton willingly remove race example following comes chicago tribune article entitled  democrats ask clinton step aside  
so democrats 
if ruling democrats hold high moral standards impose people govern would follow simple process 
they would demand mrs clinton step immediately let vice presidential nominee sen tim kaine virginia stand place 
democrats say honestly new criminal investigation going events around homebrew email server time secretary state clinton anywhere near white house good idea 
but author article understand tim kaine would automatically take place clinton steps election previous article  included quote us news  world report article explained would happen hillary clinton removed democratic ticket reason prior november th 
if clinton fall ticket democratic national committee members would gather vote replacement dnc members acted superdelegates years primary overwhelmingly backed clinton boatrocking socialist sen bernie sanders vermont 
dnc spokesman mark paustenbach says currently  committee members  number changes time guided groups bylaws give membership specific officeholders party leaders hold  spots selection states along optional  slots dnc members choose fill 
but party rules replacing presidential nominee merely specify majority members must present special meeting called committee chairman meeting would follow procedures set dnc rules bylaws committee proxy voting would allowed 
so email scandal forced hillary clinton exit race last minute majority members democratic national committee would gather select new nominee 
who would choose 
lets take look top five options 
 tim kaine 
he would seem obvious choice since hillary clintons running mate win national campaign need name recognition americans outside state virginia little familiarity 
and point proven little popularity campaign trail fact attendance many rallies key swing states measured dozens 
so seems unlikely dnc would select kaine replacement nominee 
 joe biden 
vicepresident joe biden far name recognition tim kaine recent days touting believes would actually nomination would decided run  
vice president joe biden said recent interview believed could beat former secretary state hillary clinton democratic presidential nomination pursued 
biden asked interview cnn saturday news fbi reopening criminal probe clintons use private email server secretary state made secondguess decision last year run 
but according vice president short answer thing kept running biden said recent death son beau 
unfortunately biden suffers many things kaine 
biden boring good campaign trail doesnt sort charisma would motivate people go polls large numbers 
biden would probably represent safest choice democrats might winning choice 
 bernie sanders 
bernie sanders would seem logical choice since runnerup hillary clinton truth lot things working bernie sanders 
first real loyalty democrats previously operated independent expressed desire return independent status campaign 
secondly democratic establishment much dislikes plays huge role decisions 
thirdly democratic insiders fear would another mcgovern would get absolutely wiped general election 
so even though popular radical left appears sanders would least likely choice list 
 elizabeth warren 
elizabeth warren would popular bernie sanders wing party would enable party replace hillary clinton another woman 
so definitely possibility 
but lack name recognition like sanders would concern republicans would frame candidacy another mcgovern far left policies 
 michelle obama 
one recent survey found  percent democrats would rather third term obama first term hillary clinton 
and days barack obamas approval rating running anywhere   
so thought another obama white house farfetched might think 
michelle obama better name recognition anyone else list generally wellliked american people received tremendous amount praise work campaign trail recently instance recent speech new hampshire lauded influential speech  campaign recent msn article entitled  campaign michelle obama became another political voice  
the speech amplified timing met enthusiastic response cemented obamas place star presidential race put defining stroke women view trump also voice moral authority three months leaving white house already among ranks public figures transcend politics title 
when rise level like see much weight words carry said anita mcbride former chief staff laura bush executive residence school public affairs american university know didnt like politics impassioned language used feels compelled speak people listen 
if democrats michelle obama one would select replacement nominee needed would give best chance winning donald trump 
of course obamas radical bernie sanders elizabeth warren american people become quite comfortable point 
and certainly hope michelle obama become nominee hillary clinton step aside donald trump would exceedingly difficult time defeating 
in final analysis none probably going matter anyway unlikely fbi move quickly enough force hillary clinton election day still small chance could actually happen 
and happen going turn politics america completely upside
