as predicted donald trumps victory on election day has emboldened racist conservatives to start harassing and attacking minorities 
and its even happening in the deep blue state of california where a woman spotted a sign hanging on the side of a building in the town of pittsburg and snapped a photo of it 
twitter user james thompson posted the image of the sign on the social media platform after his sister sent it to him this picture was taken in pittsburgh california my sister texted this to me  minutes agoour democracy is being tested even in california pictwittercomgdlkwlox 
 james thompson jetballin november   
the sign clearly promotes lynching to prevent africanamericans from getting equal rights 
you can hang a nr from a tree  equal rights he will never see it says 
the fbi has been notified and local police have filed a lawsuit in an effort to force the owners of the sign to remove it 
in the wake of trumps surprising and depressing victory there has been a rise in the number of racist incidents in this country in fact there have been  reports of people being bullied by trump supporters since the election night results 
these incidents include the harassment of a muslim teacher by a student in georgia and students designating water fountains white or colored at a florida high school 
frankly there are so many incidents that its difficult to list them all you can find a somewhat comprehensive tally here  
this is what trumps america looks like and its scary and this has all happend in the course of a few days as melania trump continues to tell the media that her focus will be on ending bullying what exactly does she mean by that is she going to call out all bullying including the racist bullying being perpetrated by her husbands own supporters or is she going to ignore those incidents and merely whine about people who criticize her husband because right now she isnt even first lady yet and her effort has failed miserably and she only has her husband to blame"

2,"kingdoms energy minister says move would risk damaging the us economy  shares
   
saudi arabia has warned donald trump that the incoming us president will risk the health of his countrys economy if he acts on his election promises to block oil imports
over the course of the twoyear american election process republican nominee trump promised on the campaign trail to divest us interests from our foes and the oil cartels referring mainly to the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec of which the ksa is the largest producer and de facto leader
at his heart presidentelect trump will see the benefits and i think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not healthy khalid alfalih  chairman of aramco and saudi aramco oil minister told the financial times in marrakesh where world leaders are currently negotiating the nuts and bolts of the landmark  climate change agreement
saudi arabia is the us largest middle eastern oil supplier though the north american country gets most of its energy from domestic and canadian sources
alfalih added that the free trade energy culture currently in place benefits the united states because it has created a refining industry and ignited a jobhungry shale revolution
more setting the method to probe ussaudi wars how the occupied mentality syndrome works will a  page congressional report on  unravel us foreign policy the occupied mentality syndrome the us is sort of the flagbearer for capitalism and free markets according to alfalih the us continues to be a very important part of a global industry that is interconnected that is dealing with a fungible commodity which is crude oil so having equalization through free trade is very healthy for oil
during presidential race donald trump had blamed saudi arabia for the  terrorist attacks and in march the real estate magnate said he would consider stopping us oil purchases from saudi arabia and other arab allies unless the saudi government provided ground troops to fight isis
ny daily news revealed trump sold the th floor of trump world tower to the kingdom of saudi arabia for  million in june  according to a city finance department spokeswoman in  the apartments became part of the saudi mission to the united nations records show
the reports emerged back then revealed the reality of trumps relations with the riyadh regime but mr trump has not always expressed a positive view of the middle eastern country"
3,"worst of saudi economic slump yet to come  
press tv 
experts say the outlook for saudi economic recovery will remain murky for many months to come with some even warning that the worst of the economic slump for the kingdom is yet to come 
reuters in a report quoted several riyadhbased experts as saying that there would be a high degree of uncertainty over the status of the saudi economy in  that would mainly be a result of the remaining challenges from the private sector 
the saudi economy may appear to have escaped a fiscal and currency crisis that loomed at the start of  however experts said threats from certain basic problems still remain and will haunt the kingdom next year 
the government owes its success to temporarily escape crisis to unpaid bills rather than sustainable spending cuts 
the government has reduced or suspended payments that it owed to construction firms medical establishments and even some of the foreign consultants who helped to design the economic reforms reuters added quoting the experts the estimated unpaid dues for construction firms alone totaled  billion riyals 
experts further warned that this could store up obligations for riyadh in the future 
reuters elsewhere emphasized that signs of the economic slump could be seen in riyadh and other major cities where discounts of  percent or more are offered by stores selling clothes and consumer electronics and there is a surge in people offering secondhand cars for sale 
the biggest uncertainty may be how authorities can push through a key part of their reform drive added the report the most important issue for the saudis may be determining how they plan to foster a vibrant private sector that does not depend on oil revenues while at the same pushing ahead austerity policies that are suppressing private demand 
experts also warned that the status of the saudi job market over the next few years between  million and  million of saudi arabias  million foreign workers may leave over the next couple of years as the economic slowdown causes layoffs and the government seeks to steer saudi citizens into jobs previously held by foreigners reuters added"

the leader of iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region has assured that kurdish peshmerga forces will not set foot in mosul during a joint operation with the army and allied fighters aimed at liberating the daeshheld northern city 
the peshmerga will not enter the city of mosul masoud barzani said in a news conference with chairman of the islamic supreme council of iraq isci ammar hakim in zartac mountain near the city of nineveh on thursday 
barzani further said the kurdish fighters are coordinating their role in the mosul liberation operation with the iraqi military adding that the collaboration will continue 
the kurdish leader further highlighted unity among different iraqi political parties adding that daesh was no more a threat as most areas are back in control of the iraqi forces 
last week the popular mobilization units a mainlyshia military group backing the iraqi army in the mosul offensive also said its forces would not march into mosul adding that iraqi army soldiers and security personnel would enter the embattled city 
barzani further referred to recent daesh terror activities in the kurdishcontrolled city of kirkuk saying the takfiri terror group is making desperate attempts to cover up its defeats in the mosul battle 
we were able to control the situation quickly and kill the terrorists the kurdish leader said 
terrorists launched several rounds of attacks in the city of kirkuk over the weekend as iraqi officials are focused on the mosul offensive 
on friday at least  daesh elements went on a rampage in kirkuk to divert an iraqi and kurdish military advance on mosul the incident left  civilians and members of the security forces dead as well as  militants according to iraqi security officials leader of iraqs semiautonomous kurdistan region masoud barzani nd l receives chairman of the islamic supreme council of iraq isci ammar hakim nd r in zartac mountain near the city of nineveh october   photo by reuters 
for his part hakim highlighted the need for avoiding rifts in iraq and staying focused on the fight against daesh 
he further stressed that a turkish base present in bashiqa near mosul was not welcome 
this turkish base and the forces that came to the base were present without coordination with the iraqi government they are armed forces and we strongly refuse the participation of any noniraqi fighter in this battle hakim said 
last december turkey deployed some  soldiers equipped with heavy weapons and backed by  to  tanks to the bashiqa camp 
ankara claimed the deployment was part of a mission to train and equip iraqi kurdish peshmerga forces in the fight against daesh but baghdad denounced the unauthorized move as a violation of iraqs sovereignty 
recently ankara claimed that his country is involved in the mosul operation but baghdad denied such a role 
last week the iraqi army volunteer shia and sunni fighters as well as kurdish peshmerga forces launched a longawaited operation to wrest control of mosul the last stronghold of daesh in the arab country 
many believe that the recapture of mosul which fell to daesh in  would signal the terror outfits total defeat in iraq 
iraqi special forces commanders said thursday that the mosul operation was proceeding as planned and they were now waiting for further gains in the south before resuming their push toward the city 
the operation has not been stopped and is proceeding as planned special forces brigadier general haider fadhil said 
in another development on thursday the us estimated that up to  daesh terrorists have been killed in the mosul liberation operation so far 
general joseph votel the head the us militarys central command said the operation was taking a heavy toll on the takfiris 
there are between  and  daesh elements in mosul and up to another  in the broader area according to us figures 
more daesh tunnels uncovered 
also on thursday iraqi troops discovered several tunnels used by daesh terrorists in recently recaptured villages of bartella and bazwaia located between  and  kilometers east of mosul 
when we entered the khazna taba neighborhood in bartella and after we liberated it we found several tunnels said razed qusai alkinani a member of iraqi counterterrorism forces 
one of the tunnels which is  meters long and  meters deep was used by daesh for meetings and allowed the terror outfits ringleaders to move around during the battle he added 
elsewhere in the village of tob zawa the iraqi troops found a tire shop that had been converted into a factory for making roadside bombs and attaching armor to vehicles 
they also discovered another tunnel in the village equipped with fans and lights that ran from beneath a mosque out to a road loading"
5,"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont
read next  emotions men should master"

democratic us vicepresidential nominee tim kaine announced saturday that he believes the catholic church will change its position on samesex marriage the virginia senator said that just like he had changed his opinion on the issue the catholic church is also likely to follow suit speaking at the th annual human rights campaigns national dinner in washington the roman catholic senator reportedly said i think its going to change because my church also teaches me about a creator who in the first chapter of genesis surveyed the entire world including mankind and said it is very good 
and besides he continued we are talking here about a country that was based and founded on democracy as a core value by definition that means that every single person and every single citizen is able  no scratch that  encouraged to practice his civil religious and above all sexual liberties to the best of their abilities and im sorry that some people dont like it but to deny samesex marriage in a country that should be the first one to accept it is just pointless and the catholic church should also be accepting it instead of condemning it which is what its doing right now 
kaine also added that if all else fails there are ways of making the catholic church listen to the voice of reason which is how he dubbed all those who advocate lgbt equality at the end of the day you know were a civilized people of course the first thing well do is act nicely and ask nicely he said then if that doesnt work well use our law and our legal system to enable ourselves to be who we are or rather the lbgt community will do that  and it has the supreme courts ruling on samesex marriage was a crucial milestone in our legal system that proves it works it actually functions 
so what im saying here he argued is that while i respect the catholic church as im sure millions of americans do you know at some point it is going to start acting contrary to the christian faith and were talking about an institution thats supposed to be the first one on the front line defending it so when that happens and thats whats happening with condemning lgbt rights well state an ultimatum the united states of america more precisely the future president of the united states of america hillary clinton will state an ultimatum and that ultimatum will be to either change its stance on samesex marriage or pack its bags and get out of america and yes  the president of the country can do that 
and in case anybodys wondering  no donald trump wont do the same because he doesnt care about anyone other than donald trump on the other hand hillary clinton is a shining example of honesty integrity and democracy and you can rest assured she will do everything in her power as the president to make sure gays and lesbians throughout america are loved respected and viewed as equals during her presidential term what happens after that is not our problem kaine concluded"

before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name"

10,"keywords pet care  pet care tips 
having a pet or a companion animal is an amazing thing as the little bundle of joy loves you immensely without asking for much in return but they do want your little time and attention pets are just like kids who need care and support from you and if they dont get these things then they can become victims of infection malnutrition and diseases therefore here we have listed some important pet care tips so that you can easily keep your pet happy and healthy train your pet 
behavioral training is very important for dogs and cats especially when you have children at the house proper training can reduce their aggression and help them to accommodate easily in your home environment if you are not well experienced with pet training then you can take help of a professional trainer to train them like sitting on command or walking on a leash spaying and neutering 
if you have many pets and you dont want an increase in their numbers then you can get them spayed or neutered by a vet it also benefits your pet as it reduces the chances of your pet getting lost because the tendency to roam around will decrease after spaying and neutering it also lowers the risk of certain cancers hernias in male pets and uterine infection in females induce natural healing 
increasing immunity of your pet is very important and you can do with a much safer approach animal oral nosodes provide a wide range of protection to your pet from various diseases like corona virus lyme disease west nile virus tick fever etc and they are very easy to administer as it can be given either by mouth this natural alternative is safe and has many advantages over the conventional vaccines many of which are found to be carcinogenic or having side effects body cleaning 
it is important to get your pet habitual to bathing and other cleaning activities like clipping nails flea or tick examination etc from an early age so it doesnt get surprised when you give it a bath or try to cut its nails they can even attack you in defense if they are not used to these activities keep them active 
walking your dog early in the morning is good for him and you as well it gives you time to bond and keeps both of you fit besides that you must play with your pets regularly to keep them active you can use a frisbee or ball to play with your pets or tell them to chase you while you run these activities benefit both of you mutually skincare 
this is very important especially in the case of pets with a white coat or less pigmentation as they are prone to skin inflammation and skin cancers also check your pet regularly for any external parasite like fleas as it can cause irritated skin hair loss hot spots infection and introduction of other parasites like a tapeworm in your pet after cleaning and check up groom your pet by brushing their coat as it helps in reducing hair shedding by them watch their diet 
children tend to feed their pet anything even their favorite food without knowing that it can be harmful to them therefore inform your young ones about the right food for your pet food items containing alcohol coffee chocolate poultry bones salt or unripe fruit can be bad for your pets you can also ask your vet about other food items which must not be given to your pet moreover you also need to check the weight of your pet regularly as less physical activity and regular feeding can make them obese or overweight pet bedding 
proper rest is equally necessary for the overall wellbeing of your pet and they need a corner for their own for that you should pick a spot in your house which is warm clean and quiet to make their bed their bedding should be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent any parasites like ticks and fleas provide a healthy environment 
your pet can understand your mood as it is a living being like you therefore try to act happily around them you must have seen that your cat is scratching the post or toys or your dog becomes restless when you come home they do these things because they need mental stimulation give them toys to play take them on a walk and play with them to reduce their restlessness and keep their boredom away pet identification 
this prevents your pet from getting lost or taken away by the municipal persons by considering them as stray ones make them wear a collar with the address of your house so that it can be returned to you if it gets lost these days microchips are used to identify the pet these microchips are of the size of a rice grain and placed under the skin of the pet within a second it doesnt require any battery and sensitive enough to be scanned and tracked easily by a vet or animal control officer you might also like"

black voters helped hillary beat bernie but theyre not turning out for her in early voting  neither are millennials 
after sunday nights polls closed black vot ers accounted for  percent of the inperson early vote ballots cast and that included five previous days of inperson early voting 
but in  in just two days of inperson early voting blacks cast  percent of those early ballots according to dan smith a university of florida political science professor who published some of the early voting data on his mustread election smith blog 
due to such strong africanamerican turnout after the beginning of inperson early voting in  democrats began outpacing republicans in total ballots cast before election day by about  this year though republicans still cling to their own lead of about  as of monday morning about  million absentee and inperson early ballots had been cast  percent of them by republicans and  percent by democrats 
hillary is getting latino support largely due to the immigration debate but she just doesnt have the hot sauce draw that her husband and obama did that leaves her more dependent on white voters and forces her to zigzag between moderate and extreme positions which only adds to her reputation for untrustworthiness"

former secretary of state hillary clinton arranged a  million donation from moroccan king mohammed vi to her familys charity in  in return for the clinton global initiative hosting its international meeting in the north african muslim nation according to an email made public thursday by wikileaks 
the moroccan monarchs funds went to the clinton foundations endowment and to cgi the jan   email was included in wikileaks latest batch of communications to and from clintons presidential campaign chairman john podesta 
the email from huma abedin clintons deputy chief of staff at the state department was addressed to podesta and campaign manager robby mook hillary clinton was a director of the foundation at the time 
singapore and hong kong officials reportedly were also vying to convene the cgi meeting in their countries but the north african nation ultimately hosted it in a fivestar hotel in marrakesh morocco in  abedin told podesta and mook that morocco was not cgis first choice 
the actual meeting was paid for by ocp the moroccangovernmentowned mining company that has been accused of serious human rights violations clinton vigorously supported the moroccan king when she was secretary of state and the usfinanced exportimport bank gave ocp a  million loan guarantee during her tenure as secretary of state 
the mining company also contributed between  million to  million to the clinton foundation according to the charitys web siteabedin described the arrangement in the email as having been organized by her boss hillary clinton created this mess and she knows it she told podesta and mookshe said the moroccan deal was entirely dreamed up by her boss this was hrcs idea our office approached the moroccans and they  percent believe they are doing this at her request the king has personally committed approx  million both for the endowment and to support the meeting hrc stands for hillary rodham clinton 
abedin said clintons attendance at the cgi event was a condition of the  million contribution just to give you some context the condition upon which the moroccans agreed to host the meeting was her participation if hrc was not part if it meeting was a nonstarter abedin said 
politico in  reported that clinton was seen by rabat as among its most ardent supporters in the obama administration rabat is the capital of morocco 
the robert f kennedy center for justice charged ocp with serious human rights violations including exploitation of workers by not adequately compensating the impoverished people who live there 
mohamed yeslem beisat the washington envoy for the polisaro front as reported by almonitor a middle east news site in  that ocp is the first beneficiary of the war and the first beneficiary of the occupation  it is the one that is cashing in on the misery of thousands of refugees and hundreds of political detainees for the past  years 
polisaro claims to lead a moroccan governmentinexile based in tindouf algeria 
theyre doing this because they know hillary has some chances of being president of the united states and they want her to support their brutal occupation of western sahara beisat charged 
the moroccan firm mines phosphates human rights critics have called ocps mining product blood phosphates appropriating the term blood diamonds for gems mined in operations that kill and injure local workers 
ocp is not the only mining company linked to human rights violations that has donated to the clinton foundation the foundation accepted a  million pledge from lukas lundin who owns mining and oil drilling operations in north africa and in the congo related clinton foundation got m from blood minerals firm 
ocp retained the law firm of covington  burling one of washingtons lobbying giants paying the firm  million in fees from  to  
stuart eizenstat a former white house domestic policy chief under president carter and an influential democratic party insider was the main lobbyist for the mining firm he was also president bill clintons ambassador to the european union a deputy secretary of the treasury and under secretary at the department of commerce 
eizenstat specialized in foreign trade issues at commerce where he worked in the international trade administration 
hillary clinton officially visited morocco twice in november  and in february  meeting with the king on both occasions the two also met in new york in december  where it was believed the two discussed moroccos bid to host the cgi meeting and the kings  million donation 
the moroccan world news described the meeting as showing renewed friendship between the royal family and the clinton family as well as hillary clintons esteem for morocco and its people 
abedin warned both campaign executives that if cgi decided to renege on the agreement it would hurt clintons relationship with the king it will break a lot of china to back out now she wrote 
ultimately clinton did not attend the meeting because it was close to the launch of her presidential campaign but the former president and daughter chelsea were present and during the conference were guests at one of the moroccan kings palaces"

20," share the amish in america have committed their vote to donald trump guaranteeing him the presidency ap photo  dennis system 
columbus oh ap  history was made today in columbus ohio when more than  million amish poured into the city to see the american amish brotherhood aab an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the amish community endorse donald trump for president that number represents a significant portion of the total amish population which the united states census bureau says numbers more than  million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to trump for president with the full force of the amish community behind him donald trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in november 
the organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about  amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges such as urban sprawl that face the community this year however the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant republican nominee 
the amish who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the anabaptists have typically stayed out of politics in the past as a general rule they dont vote serve in the military or engage in any other displays of patriotism this year however the aab has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process 
over the past eight years the democratic party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues said aab chairman menno simons we have seen more and more christians being persecuted for their faith we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage now they want to put a woman in the nations highest leadership role in direct violation of  timothy  we need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles donald trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the lords way 
according to statistician nate silver of the website fivethirtyeightcom there are no possible scenarios in which hillary clinton can win with donald trump carrying the amish vote 
the amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like pennsylvania virginia ohio indiana and iowa silver noted they also have strong numbers in reliably democratic states like michigan illinois and new york meaning that hillary will lose those states as well there is also a sizeable community in florida which while not as large as it is in the midwest is still large enough to turn florida for trump over the next two weeks you can expect hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models 
the clinton campaign issued a written statement to the aab asking them to reconsider their decision 
i dont believe that donald trump is the person who best represents your interests clinton wrote to the aab as a career real estate developer he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life as former first lady of arkansas i understand the concerns of rural americans more than any candidate in this election i implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent 
most pundits believe that mrs clintons plea is too little too late 
during a press conference in manhattan trump thanked the aab for their support and promised to put the amish to work maintaining government buildings which he said would save taxpayers millions because the amish do great work for a very low price 
though clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end many of her campaign workers have already resigned according to the associated press it is expected that the clinton campaign will lose  of its staff over the next two weeks there is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the clinton camp and many simply want to cut their losses 
it looked like she was going to win this election easily said paul horner a campaign worker in ohio but this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant cleary mrs clinton took far too much for granted in this race and we are all now paying the price its really sad to see the campaign end this way

22,"hillary campaign launching attacks on the fbi october   
if the clinton campaign becomes any more deranged hillary will start running attack ads against the fbi this kind of tactic is already perilously close to an attack ad 
hillary clintons presidential campaign ratcheted up its attack on the director of the fbi on sunday circulating a draft letter critical of james comey to former federal prosecutors 
it is out of our respect for such settled tenets of the united states department of justice that we are moved to express our concern with the recent letter issued by fbi director james comey to eight congressional committees the clinton campaigns letter speaking for prosecutors said 
the letter was signed and provided to the daily beast by elkan abramowitz a former chief of the criminal division of the us attorney for the southern district of new york it is expected to be released sunday evening 
so we have the bizarre spectacle of hillary deciding that she needs to campaign against the head of the fbi who was just being praised for clearing her because when youre a paranoid personality who assembles lists of enemies this is how you react but its also telling that the clinton campaign finds this so threatening that it is waging war on the fbi"

24,"keywords cardiovascular  diabetes  dietary fat  heart disease  sugar  sugar industry 
sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease when it comes to dietary claims made by the sugar industry we need to take them with a grain of salt 
researchers at the university of california san francisco have uncovered documents and communications dating back as far as the s revealing that the srf sugar research foundation now known as the sugar association funded research to serve its own interest to create a sweet image of sugar 
at the time heart disease was on the rise as was the consumption of dietary fat and sugar instead of trying to determine the true cause for the higher occurrence of the disease the biased research focused everyones attention on fat 
ucsfs finding published in jama internal medicine shows researchers at leading universities including harvard were paid by the srf in an effort to portray dietary fat as the major cause of heart disease in the process sugars role in the fatal disease has been ignored singing the praises of lowfat foods 
as a result of the biased research published in many esteemed publications life in the second half of the th century was filled with misleading dietary recommendations and scary headlines 
warnings regarding the dangers of dietary fat ran rampant eating fat especially the saturated variety was equivalent to clogging your arteries even eating an egg containing  grams of the forbidden macronutrient was considered a luxury not to be indulged in more than once per week 
lowfat diets became the craze in fact lowfat labels decorated food packaging throughout groceries stores from yoghurt aisles to frozen sections consumers felt good whenever they chose lowfat varieties over standard options 
yet this sense of wellbeing generated by the lowfat fad was unfounded to add flavour to lowfat foods sugar was the usual substitute and the truth that has been uncovered is that sugar is a secret killer it contributes not only to obesity and diabetes but also to the leading cause of death worldwide cardiovascular disease cvd a time for change 
recently the sugar industrys funded research has been challenged by unbiased studies which reveal sugar to possess the unwelcome property previously and falsely attributed to fat it leads to atherosclerosis 
jama internal medicine has published a study by a team of ucsf researchers showing that sugar aside from causing diabetes and tooth decay sets into motion several changes that bring on heart disease in this study the diets of  children were changed to replace added sugar with starch while maintaining the same amounts of protein fat complex carbohydrates and total caloric intake the results showed beneficial effects on ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels as well as diastolic blood pressure 
another study undertaken by researchers from saint lukes mid america heart institute and albert einstein college of medicine and published in progress in cardiovascular diseases showed that consuming diets high in added sugar caused an increase in ldl bad cholesterol total cholesterol and triglycerides while lowering hdl good cholesterol 
the new research results have brought about a change in worldwide dietary guidelines from governmental associations to medical organisations and private practitioners are warning consumers and patients about sugars toxicity 
the us dietary guidelines for  to  recommend that added sugars make up less than  percent of a persons daily calorie consumption while the main reason for this recommendation is that added sugar constitutes empty calories and leads to a nutrientdeficient diet the guidelines also acknowledge that there is strong evidencelower intake of sources of added sugars are associated with reduced risk of cvd in adults 
the american heart association warns that too much added sugar in your diet could significantly increase your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease it recommends lowering dietary sugar intake even further to a maximum of  teaspoons and  teaspoons for women and men respectively how can something sweet be so bad 
according to one cardiologist dr stephen sinatra sugar delivers its damage to the cardiovascular system via a surge in insulin high levels of insulin wreak havoc on blood vessels endothelial linings an inflammatory response ensues causing the walls of the blood vessels to become clogged in this way the stage is set for heart disease 
add to that the wellknown fact that sugar leads to diabetes which raises the risk of heart disease and the overall danger is compounded addictive properties exacerbate the problem 
it seems that the sugar industry pushed us toward a secret killer just like the tobacco industry did this notion seems even more valid in light of medical claims that sugar like nicotine is an addictive substance 
in medical circles addiction is an altered state of the brain which causes repetitive behaviour despite negative consequences experts state that studies on rats prove sugar to be more addictive than cocaine 
when our bodies digest sugar they release dopamine and opioids these neurotransmitters play a key role in the brains reward centre which in turn causes addiction to the same substance that set off too much activity in this pleasure circuit so what do we do now 
we need to gather public funding to carry out unbiased research on consumer goods including foods 
food labels should allow consumers to identify easily how much added sugar is present in every food item 
every processed food item should not be allowed to contain more than  percent of its total calories from added sugars 
widespread education regarding sugars toxicity should reach from the classroom to our doctors offices 
everyone deserves the chance to break the cycle of sugar addiction

25,"interviews syria should be able to choose its allies in the battle against daesh says american political analyst james petras 
the pentagons plan to launch an offensive against the daesh isil terrorist group in syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group says james petras an american political commentator 
us defense secretary ashton carter told nbc news on wednesday that the pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust daesh from the syrian city of raqqah the terror groups stronghold in the country 
carter who was in iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of mosul from daesh said the raqqah offensive would begin when iraqs second largest city is cleared 
he claimed that us forces wont be directly involved in any of the operations 
this is a ploy to have the us in northern syria petras said arguing that the us was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflictridden country 
i dont believe that the attack on raqqah is a positive move because i think it brings the us closer to its policy of establishing a nofly zone in northern syria which will directly affect the efforts of the syrian government and its alliesiran and russiato defend the country 
the analyst noted that raqqah is a problem for the syrian people and damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle 
petras went on to note that carters remarks bear similarities to us democratic presidential candidate hillary clintons plans for a conflagration in the middle east 
the ongoing western efforts in syria have a different nature washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove president bashar alassad from power 
carters claim that us ground forces will have no part in the fight against daesh came at a time when more than  american soldiers were stationed in iraq tasked with providing training and intelligence to iraqi forces loading"

so warns the stalinist regime that jailed and tortured  cuban women for political crimes a totalitarian horror utterly unknown in the western hemisphere until the castro brothers and che guevara took power some of these cuban ladies suffered twice as long in castros gulag as alexander solzhenitsyn suffered in stalins 
their prison conditions were described by former political prisoner maritza lugo the punishment cells measure  feet wide by  feet long the toilet consists of an  inch hole in the ground through which cockroaches and rats enter especially in cool temperatures the rat come inside to seek the warmth of our bodies and we were often bitten the suicide rate among women prisoners was very high

 make sure to ask for an exact salary before the mans fingers start moving up your leg it might seem daunting at first to directly ask for money but if you dont come with an exact number in mind the man with his hand on your knee will end up confused with little direction information about how much of a bump to give you calculate an appropriate new salary so you can bargain but when you do avoid mentioning the salaries of any other coworkers whose legs he has also touched because this is about you not them 
 dont mention the hand a real negotiator stays on target and doesnt let daytoday work conversations creep into business mentioning or even looking at the hand is a surefire way to upset the man with his hand on your knee and bring the meeting to a close without getting a raise keep your message laserfocused 
 be prepared for a no look you might not get a raise this time but dont worry its not personal thats just business and sometimes you have to ask once twice or even three more times before the man with his hand on your knee finally gives you a raise and if he doesnt who knows might be time for a new job"

foreign ministers of iran russia and syria have started trilateral talks on a political solution to the syria crisis besides a serious fight against the takfiri terror groups operating in the arab country 
on friday iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and his russian and syrian counterparts sergei lavrov and walid muallem gathered in moscow for a threeway meeting 
ahead of the meeting lavrov said the three nations are acting as a united front against terrorism saying their talks are mainly focused on ways of seriously tackling terrorism particularly in syria 
the three sides lavrov added will exchange views on humanitarian operations as well as efforts to stop the flow of weapons and military equipment to the foreignbacked militants operating against the damascus government 
prior to the threeway discussions zarif held a bilateral meeting with lavrov to discuss regional issues and the further enhancement of bilateral tehranmoscow ties russian foreign minister sergei lavrov r welcomes his iranian counterpart mohammad javad zarif during a meeting in moscow on october   photo by afp 
upon his arrival at vnukovo international airport in moscow on friday morning zarif said a political solution besides a serious fight against terrorism is the only way out of the crisis gripping syria 
unfortunately some countries have always pursued war and a military solution in syria this is while the solution to this crisis is of a political nature and also entails battles against takfiri groups said zarif 
he added we have always emphasized the need for the establishment of an allout ceasefire humanitarian operations and efforts to find a political solution to the syrian issue 
following the trilateral talks the three ministers attended a joint press conference 
during the presser muallem slammed the usled coalition purportedly fighting daesh saying the alliance has never been fighting terrorism despite its claims 
he said the washingtonled campaign was in fact encouraging daesh terrorists to move from iraqs mosul to syrias raqqah 
mosul and raqqah have served as the main daesh bases in the middle east over the past years iraqi and syrian armed forces are engaged in largescale military offensive to drive the terror group from the two cities 
the syrian foreign minister further said his country would continue cooperation with iran and russia in efforts to eradicate terrorism 
muallem described the atmosphere of the talks in russia as positive and very comfortable 
we in syria have become convinced of the sincerity of the russian and iranian efforts in helping us rout terrorism he added russian foreign minister sergei lavrov c syrian foreign minister walid almuallem r and iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif attend a news conference in moscow russia october   photo by reuters 
zarif in turn described the talks in moscow as very productive saying iran and russia have developed very close relations in different areas 
commenting on the situation in syria the top iranian diplomat said syrias sovereignty and territorial integrity must be protected adding that it is up to the syrian nation to determine its own destiny and that the voice of the syrians must be recognized 
he further highlighted the need for a political settlement of the crisis adding that tehran backs the resumption of peace talks between the syrian government and opposition 
the iranian minister called for a ceasefire in syria joint battles against terror groups as well as efforts to facilitate aid delivery to syrian civilians in besieged areas 
he said the global community must unite in the battle against terrorism which poses a threat not only to syria but the entire world 
zarif added that supporting terrorism would serve the interest of no one warning that the terror groups would eventually bite the hands that feed them 
for his part the russian foreign minister also touched on the mosul battle in iraq saying that iraqi citys liberation from daesh would have a significant impact on the balance of power in neighboring syria 
lavrov said the political settlement in syria should be achieved through dialogue according to the security council resolutions welcoming syrias readiness to resume the stalled talks with the opposition 
referring to the situation in aleppo lavrov said terrorists blocked the exit routes opened as part of a syrian humanitarian pause and prevented the civilians from leaving the eastern neighborhoods of aleppo city 
the senior russian official also criticized the international organizations for failing to fulfill their duties towards the locals of eastern aleppo 
lavrov emphasized that the fight against terrorism in syria will continue adding that future common steps in this regard during the moscow talks loading"

  monsanto  hillary clinton fundraiser  charles burson naturalnews wikileaks email  part of the john podesta email leaks reveals that the hillary clinton campaign sought money from a top monsanto executive to put her into the white house see the email here hillary clinton known as the bride of frankenfood  is a longtime supporter of monsanto a corporation whose deceptive tactics of collusion intimidation and bullying are a perfect fit for the clinton regime which even a former fbi official now describes as a criminal operation the monsanto operative invited to the fundraiser was none other than charles w burson monsantos former executive vp secretary and general counsel burson who retired from monsanto in  but still maintained an active monsantocom email address all the way through  was praised by monsanto ceo hugh grant for pushing the corporations international imperialism agenda to force patented seeds down the throats of poor farmers in developing nations its sickening via pr newswire  on behalf of the monsanto board of directors and the employees of monsanto i thank charles for his service to our company said hugh grant chairman president and chief executive officer of monsanto during his tenure monsanto successfully transitioned from an agricultural company fueled by its chemistry business to one led by its seeds and traits businesses charles has played an important role in building the companys legal organization to better serve our growing business not only in the united states but also in latin america and asiapacific where farmers are increasingly choosing to plant monsanto seeds and technologies clinton fundraiser sought money from one of the most evil corporations in the history of humankind in other words charles burson was instrumental in monsanto suing farmers whose fields were contaminated by genetically modified monsanto seeds  this legal action by monsanto is globally considered to be one of the most evil antihuman rights abuses of legal power ever witnessed in the modern world yet the hillary clinton campaign saw this man as an opportunity to raise more money to put hillary clinton into the white house where no doubt she would return the favor to monsanto through government policy decisions at the usda and fdafully consistent with the criminal conduct of the clinton crime mafia charles burson also took part in excusing monsantos illegal bribery of over  indonesian officials as part of its international agricultural imperialism march against subsistence farmersafter caught committing massive bribery and collusion in indonesia monsantos then general counsel charles burson explained that no monsanto isnt a bad company theyre super honest and transparent and ethical toothe company has taken remedial actions to address the activities in indonesia at every stage of this process  beginning with our voluntary disclosure and throughout the governmental investigations and settlement process  monsanto has been fully cooperative and has made clear that improper activities will not be tolerated by the company we are pleased today to begin the process of putting these matters to rest wrote burson surprise the justice department then defers prosecution of monsanto and forgets these crimes ever happened whaddaya know with the corrupt lawless justice department calling the shots monsanto was then given a get out of jail free card by the political elite in washingtonfrom the same link above the justice department said it had agreed to defer prosecution on the criminal information for three years saying it would dismiss it after the period if monsanto fully complied with the terms of the agreement so wait you mean to tell me that a corporation which got caught bribing  foreign officials in indonesia  a felony crime under us law  was able to get away with it by claiming they will be honest from now on and the justice department says oh yes youre fine now there will be no prosecution for your serious crimes and then the clinton fundraiser people specifically reach out to the monsanto attorney who orchestrated all this and said hey this guy would be awesome to help support a

33,"theres a reason david brock founder of the liberal group media matters for america chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts brock wants his unregistered solicitor the bonner group to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught brock has seven nonprofits three super pacs one  committee one llc one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington 
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations
the bonner group his professional solicitor works off a commission every time money gets passed around bonner receives a  percent cut
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants
this weak system of oneway verification is being abused by brock hes been cycling money between his organizations for years and the bonner groups  percent commission gets triggered after every pass
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in  media matters for america raised more than  million
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds media matters paid it a  million commission

that same year media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum  an organization that shares office space with media matters

in  the franklin education forum reported  in total contributions and  percent of that total came from media matters
surprisingly though the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money it paid the fundraiser a  commission in 

notice what happened 
brocks media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds triggering the  percent commission brock paid the bonner group a  commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained  it sent a  cash grant to brocks franklin forum  

note the franklin education forum is a c and the franklin forum is a c they are not the same company 
the franklin forum c paid bonner a commission in   so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a  commission in  unfortunately its hard to tell for sure it still hasnt filed its taxes for 
lets recap 
say for example you donate  to media matters for america this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 
media matters would receive your  donation the bonner group would earn a  commission media matters would retain  next media matters would give whats left of your entire donation   to the franklin education forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin education forum would retain  the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining  to the franklin forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin forum would retain  in the end brocks solicitor would have pocketed  almost a third of your initial donation thats a far cry from the advertised  percent commission
as bizarre as that scenario may sound this is exactly what brock did in 
how can we be sure this is intentional 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations how could he not know whats going on
hes a handson chairman according to their tax returns brock allocates time weekly to his organizations
media matters  hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner the president of the bonner group
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this these transfers are intentional he vacations with his solicitor case closed
still not convinced 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers they all share the same number

what if  
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide  clarification on the commission can be found on page 

in english contractually brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission in spite of this option he intentionally chooses to trigger the  percent commission for money grants between his organizations
note yes we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group given that his organizations share the same address board members and telephone number we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing publicfacing tax returns along with records submitted to the federal election commission we mapped out all the significant money transfers from  that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year no further commentary required
we understand this may be hard to believe we first came across this in july and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office these data have been sitting out in the open gathering dust for years 
if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity but there arent any loopholes david brock has something to hide just last month the daily caller reported the following
brocks former longtime livein boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire what did brock do he paid grey  to keep quiet brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth delaware to come up with the money this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover
adding to this fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs grey wrote in an email dated may   this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified we feel confident in saying with close to absolute certainty that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate

john key channels nz taxpayers money to clinton foundation 


this is information that every taxpayer or those that care should know about but our journalists are not doing their job  

what with warships in our harbour and troops in iraq this government of john key is in lockstep with the most corrupt and warmongering part of the us government 

no doubt key would approve of the clintons defrauding the people of haiti its his style 

the cannabis party is calling on john key to explain why he gave over  million of new zealand taxpayers money to the clinton foundation  

legalise cannibis party 

 october  

wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the clinton foundation when it published a hacked email send to clinton campaign chairman john podesta revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of bill and hillary clinton 

cannabis party leader julian crawford said if john key was serious about hiv prevention one of the clinton foundations supposed goals he should legalise medical cannabis in new zealand 

hundreds of researchers have reported that thc was able to destroy the riv virus in monkeys that virus is nearly identical to the hiv virus found in humans he said 

john key has a lot of explaining to do if the wikileaks revelations about the clinton foundation are true 

former assistant director of the fbi thomas fuentes confirmed that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation 

new zealands national business review has reported that john key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to the foundation in the future despite the criminal investigation of hillary clinton 

ive met her on lots of occasions had dinner with her at premier house a few times john key said 

as secretary of state she was great very engaged with new zealand broadcaster duncan garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the clinton foundation known as paytoplay 

we also give money to the clinton foundation yes we did gosh who didnt get a handout garner said 

weve been feeding all these guys at the trough for years 

paytoplay refers to operations where bill and hillary clinton rewarded big donors to their foundation with preferential access to the us government

37,"loading posted on november   this professor devotes her life to countering dangerous speech she cant ignore donald trumps colby itkowitz washington post october   
when susan benesch began looking at how speech could incite mass violence her research took her to farflung places like kenya and burma 
lately shes been unable to ignore a case study at home in the united states 
the american university law professor and harvard university faculty associate has grappled for months with whether donald trumps rhetoric constitutes dangerous speech as she has come to define it she has examined electionyear speech before but only abroad where the risks of mass atrocities were great 
but in the past week with trump claiming that the election system and the media are rigged against him his messages have the type of undertone that increases the risk of violence between groups she said 
benesch  has dedicated the past six years of her life to developing and testing a framework for identifying dangerous speech to rise to that level at least two of these five indicators must be true a powerful speaker with a high degree of influence over the audience the audience has grievances and fears that the speaker can cultivate a speech act that is clearly understood as a call to violence a social or historical context that is propitious for violence for any of a variety of reasons including longstanding competition between groups for resources lack of efforts to solve grievances or previous episodes of violence a means of dissemination that is influential in itself for example because it is the sole or primary source of news for the relevan t audience 
trumps speech is very difficult in the sense that he is so often slippery with it benesch said in a recent interview the meaning is so often ambiguous 
but when trump said his supporters could use the second amendment against hillary clinton it seems to me impossible that people didnt understand that as a reference to violence she said or when he suggested that clinton and president obama were founders of the islamic state something he alluded to again at wednesdays final debate that was a hallmark of dangerous speech to describe an ingroup member as the enemy she said 
and now with trump trafficking in the conspiracy theory that if he loses the election it will be because of a rigged system against him hes definitely laying the groundwork for potential unrest after the balloting direct incitement of violence is illegal but trump falls short of actually calling for any kind of civil disobedience 
because of that its still a gray area that surrounds whether trump does use dangerous speech 
trump may well be undermining the extent to which his supporters trust the essential institutions and practices of us democracy benesch said some of themthose who are most susceptible to being inflamed by such messagesmay therefore be more likely to commit violence however the united states is not in danger of mass intergroup violence in my view it is deeply irresponsible though since it can undermine some americans belief in our own democratic institutions which can make them more susceptible to dangerous speech going forward

39,"how the nevertrumpers sunk themselves november   
bruce thornton is a shillman journalism fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
the chorus of nevertrumpers is wailing ever louder as election day and hillarys supposed victory approach after more than a year of complaining about trump crashing their political soiree the republicans attacking trump still dont seem to get how their own behavior contributed to the perception that they are outoftouch elites disdainful of the republican masses 
a recent example comes from premier nevertrumper bret stephens of the wall street journal  in his column stephens bids farewell to a republican party stupid enough to nominate trump contrasting it with his imagined golden age of republican policy excellence that trump and his followers have destroyed one policy in particular immigration reveals the distance between the political and pundit elite and the voting masses that helped make trump the nominee 
at a  republican primary debate in houston candidates george hw bush and ronald reagan were asked whether the children of illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public schools for free mr bush said they should were creating a whole society of really honorable decent familyloving people that are in violation of the law he lamented 
reagan agreed instead of putting up a fence he asked why dont we    make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit and then while theyre working and earning here they pay taxes here for good measure reagan suggested we should open the border both ways 
where in the populist fervor to build a wall with mexico and deport millions of human beings is that republican party today 
take bush seniors statement first it repeats basically the same clichés that the bipartisan gang of eight recycled in  during their push for comprehensive immigration reform another euphemism for amnesty all those hardworking familyvalues illegal immigrants are embryonic conservatives we were told who just need legal status and social recognition so they can come out of the shadows as john mccain said and start voting republican the political apple doesnt fall far from the tree son jeb ended his presidential ambitions by calling illegal immigration an act of love 
this stance on illegal immigration by republican politicos and pundits is obviously lightyears from the experience and position of many ordinary people take mccains oftrepeated trope of living in the shadows seriously illegal alien young people openly protest on live television knowing they are not going to be deported millions visit emergency rooms for free and wrangle food stamps welfare transfers school lunches and all sorts of largess all the while they live protected by sanctuary cities and living in the shadows doesnt deter them from committing felonies given that even if caught convicted and deported theyll soon be back remember juan francisco lopezsanchez the illegal alien deported five times who murdered kate steinle or angel gilberto garciaavalos another fivetime deportee who just this month started a  million fire in sequoia national park he had just been released from the kern county jail but could not be deported because of californias lunatic sanctuary city law which prohibits a sheriff from contacting federal agents 
simply repeating the hardworking family values religious mantra doesnt address the problems of illegal immigration there are such illegal immigrants as i know from over sixty years of personal experience living in the san joaquin valley one of the largest concentrations of illegal aliens in the country i grew up with mexicanamericans theyre members of my immediate family theyre my friends students and colleagues theyre also the victims of the crimes and disorder caused by our porous border 
some illegals do transition into these sort of immigrants but many do not a rigorous vetting process might sort out the wheat from the chaff but bush mccain and stephens have not proposed a workable rigorous mechanism for determining who should stay and who should go that means with any form of amnesty citizenship will likely be granted indiscriminately with only the most egregious felons sifted out if any are stupid enough to apply for citizenship rather than continuing to live in the shadows but all those guilty of duis hitandruns or defrauding the welfare system with fake ids will stayand then bring their extended families under the provisions of the disastrous  immigration act which enshrined family reunification with no limits on relatives of us citizens 
equally tonedeaf is stephenss bringing up ronald reagans open the border both ways thats exactly what he did in  when he signed the simpsonmazzoli act which granted amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with promises of border enforcement that never materialized stephens doesnt mention that as a result the number of illegal immigrants increased from about  million to  million creating todays crisis the obvious lesson is secure the border first then figure out what to do with the  million it would be governmental malfeasance to repeat reagans mistake 
the problem with politicians and pundits like stephens is they dont live with the consequences of indiscriminately letting in people from very different cultures and mores people like stephens dont live daily with the disorder and crime that results theyre not aware of the extensive damage to quality of life the illegal immigration version of broken windows such as dogs without rabies shots running free health and safety codes ignored building codes shrugged off garbage and refuse dumped everywhere copper wire stolen from pumps and street lights and chronic petty theftand thats on top of stolen cars hitandruns driving without insurance gangbanging and dealing drugs 
and if mr stephens thinks im just a nativist or xenophobe or racist i dare him to visit the san joaquin valley better yet let him bring his wife and children to live there for a month come and tour a hospital emergency room a social security disability office a public school a county jail and then wax lyrical about these honorable decent familyloving people it would take just a week for mr stephens to develop a fervor for a fivefoot high wall around his house and buy four or five pit bulls and a shotgun then again he wouldnt last that long within a day hed scurry back to his nice white secure tony neighborhood where he doesnt have to pay the cost of his moral preening 
and that hypocrisy is where trump came from in the perception of millions of votersperceptions nevertrumpers have fed so incessantly that they look a lot like realitythe conservative politicians and pundits care more about their privileged status and purity of principle than they do about the welfare and interests of their partys voters and so they would rather see a venal perjurious corrupt mediocrity become obama  and continue the progressive destruction of the constitutional order than see elected the nominee of their own party what sort of principle is that"
40,"the war against payday lending apple uses similar tactics with iphone jonathan lee  misesorg  october   comments image credits flickr khrawlings  
in june of  the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb put forward a proposal to regulate the shortterm loan industry 
the small dollar lending rule seeks to alleviate and solve for the apparent weaknesses of the current rates and shortterm lenders by requiring lenders to assess and verify a borrowers income housing costs and credit and legal obligations 
the intention of the proposal is to protect lowincome families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are forced to take out another loan to make ends meet at first glance it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its dirtiness except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their airconditioned offices away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of shortterm loans just the fact that they see the shortterm loan industry as dirty supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative 
instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the shortterm lending industry they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water 
in understanding the cfpb proposal for payday and other small loans a paper released by the cfpb and pew charitable trusts the bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation 
the first of its arguments is that with payday and vehicle title loan markets lenders and borrowers interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers but doesnt this argument stand for any industry that sells a product 
for example are the interests of iphone sellers and buyers aligned in the manner acceptable to the cfpb each additional iphone  is said to cost  to produce and is sold for  dollars that is  times its cost to make to borrow a phrase from the left thats pricegouging to the tune of  percent yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call apple a company that cheats its customers 
so why should shortterm lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than apple shouldnt shortterm lenders be able to charge interest rates that makeup for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to lowincome borrowers 
studies show these lenders charge on average  percent or  for every  loaned  a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets 
the second of the cfpbs arguments is that to solve for balloon payments or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans the cfpb would require that most products become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
the problem with this statement is that the bureau completely ignores the reason why shortterm loans are so available to borrowers  its because shortterm loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow 
simply put the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow additionally making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model making shortterm lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency 
the third of the cfpbs arguments is that their proposal would solve the problems related to price gouge lending by requiring lenders to evaluate borrowers financial condition by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income housing expenses all outstanding debt and child support meanwhile the lender is required to obtain a national credit report and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies 
remember all of these governmentimposed requirements cost the shortterm lenders money the cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates the result would either lead shortterm loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans 
lastly the cfpb heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by the pew charitable trusts survey research that the vast majority of borrowers want  most products to become installment loans with smaller manageable payments 
at first glance it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance due to the risk of shortterm loans many of those surveyed actually sent in raving reviews in support of shortterm loans 
in fact more than  percent of the  submissions to the bureaus  tell your story  program  where people sent in their experiences regarding shortterm loans  were positive and excessively thankful for these loans 
these responses ranged from there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like this to a simple thank you this study was personally conducted by the cfpb unsatisfied with the results they hid it from the publics view until a freedom of information act request forced them to release it 
this holding back of information demonstrates that the bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help rather they have a keen eye for policy symbolism and the flash of fighting for the underdog when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back 
policymakers continue the belief that shortterm loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college or they simply want to be perceived as someone who cares but we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals we cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt instead we need to look at the coldhard facts the numbers that the cfpb uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false 
the small dollar lending rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back  it will only hurt the people it claims it will help let americans make decisions for themselves  theyre smarter and more riskaverse than washington insiders give them credit for

during a radio interview comic legend and political pundit jackie mason joked that the only time hillary clinton is not lying is when her mouth is not movingand even then she is probably lying because shes probably sitting there thinking of the next lie she is going to tell he added 
mason claimed that clinton is so untrustworthy that she likely couldnt land a job as an attendant in the ladies room because they would be afraid that she would steal the towels or the napkins even the toilet paper wouldnt be safe from her 
mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporters talk radio program aaron klein investigative radio broadcast on new yorks am  the answer and newstalk  am in philadelphia 
he continued 
do you think that if she went for any other job besides the presidency that anyone would hire her anywhere if you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police threequarters of her life she is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted her whole life spent fleeing from the justice departments of different countries now this yenta do you think she would be able to get any other job  
would you think they would hire her as a chambermaid do you know what all those sheets and pillowcases are worth do you think they would trust her with it after they found out the history of her life lets be honest about it if you went on a vacation would you let her watch your house while you went on vacation would you expect to come back and find anything still there"

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank  via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states  thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal email server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january   another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true  snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has 
the bush family has been quietly buying property as well with the purchase of  acres in paraguay in  yet another country good for the bush family since it does not allow extradition to any country if the death penalty is a possibility for the crime if the corruption is found to go as far back as both of the bush administrations with any connections to them being the perpetrators of the events on   the death penalty would surely be a stipulation of any extradition request apparently if things get going with prosecuting the corrupt and treasonous the bushes plan on getting out of the country as well

43,"crack in earths magnetic shield detected  
dna india 
the worlds largest and most sensitive cosmic ray monitor located in india has recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays that indicates a crack in the earths magnetic shield according to scientists 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona struck earth at a very high speed causing massive compression of the earths magnetosphere and triggering a severe geomagnetic storm 
the grapes muon telescope located at tata institute of fundamental researchs cosmic ray laboratory in ooty in tamil nadu recorded a burst of galactic cosmic rays of about  gev last year lasting for two hours 
the burst occurred when a giant cloud of plasma ejected from the solar corona and moving with a speed of about  million kilometres per hour struck our planet causing a severe compression of earths magnetosphere from  to  times the radius of earth 
it triggered a severe geomagnetic storm that generated aurora borealis and radio signal blackouts in many high latitude countries according to the study published in the journal physical review letters this week 
earths magnetosphere extends over a radius of a million kilometres which acts as the first line of defence shielding us from the continuous flow of solar and galactic cosmic rays thus protecting life on our planet from these high intensity energetic radiations 
numerical simulations performed by the grapes researchers including pravata k mohanty indicate that the earths magnetic shield temporarily cracked due to the occurrence of magnetic reconnection allowing the lower energy galactic cosmic ray particles to enter our atmosphere 
earths magnetic field bent these particles about  degree from the dayside to the nightside of the earth where it was detected as a burst by the grapes muon telescope around midnight on  june  
the data was analysed and interpreted through extensive simulation over several weeks by using the core computing farm that was built inhouse by the grapes team of physicists and engineers at the cosmic ray laboratory in ooty

 reliable sources reliablesources october   
the mainstream media likes to play the false equivalence game but there is no equivalence between trump and clinton as dale told stelter there is a massive imbalance in the frequency of dishonesty trump says dale is not a normal political liar 
for example look at the presidential debates  in which dale found  trump false statements as opposed to  by clinton 
dales judgment is that there is no comparison in her level of accuracy with her opponent 
trump also lies pointlessly argues dale explaining to brian stelter that 
he gets things wrong where there is no political advantage to be gained and in those cases it is not clear whether hes lying or confused or unwilling to take the time to learn the facts 
this was mark cubans complaint of course that trump has no interest in learning 
in the end it matters less why trump lies than that he does especially since he is busily convincing his base that hillary clinton is the dishonest candidate and it is working this is a trope frequently repeated by trumps supporters you can correct them as often as you want it will have no effect 
the lie has taken hold  one of many  many more than you likely expected and observational bias takes care of the rest the trump base is effectively lost to our shared reality and as dale tweeted last night 
if trump loses the smart republican excavation is going to have to involve some long hard base reeducation

asheville nc  a video posted to facebook this week has the internet in an uproar as it shows an asheville police officer allegedly assaulting a yearold girl

she was asking them why are yall arresting my brother mooney said the officer was being rude they didnt want to talk to them

according to police fleming was arrested and charged as an adult for resisting obstructing or delaying an officer sgt noland brown who was on the scene also told news  that she is charged with misdemeanor assault on a government official 
i have no trust in the police anymore said crystal fleming  kasees mother according to news  she says her daughter was trying to communicate with police before the incident to tell them that fore had just gotten out of the icu 
she is not trying to be disrespectful said crystal fleming but yall are not listening they were not listening

she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard 
now why was he being arrested bruismenot 
what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly 
i looked at that video  times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was  and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot 
unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member 
its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back 
have you ever fought an emotionally charged  year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and  year olds are adult sized 
cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops 
also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly 
hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless 
lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns  years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was  yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder 
since  and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve 
you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create

i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly 
and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that  yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible

lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly

your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa 
httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey 
your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less than  lb person bruismenot

his job my ass i am in complete agreement with gininitaly in my town we have the same situations with no brutality from the police they are pretty much respected here some rare exceptions it all depends on the mayor chief council hiring policies and just whether they keep assholes on the job gininitaly

cops are such cowards and pussysstep on my feet and im gonna arrest yallcowardscops only feel like real men when they are beating up womenall cops are just plain criminals gina 
you all make me sick the problem today is that we raise children to disrespect authority and then feel we can call moral high ground against those that are in place to help 
our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences 
the point of no return that i see in this video is a  year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress 
and before anyone touts unlawful bull it is clearly stated that a warrant was in place for the arrest and as such she was wrong for interfering 
mom is equally to blame filming it hoping to make a quick buck or news scandal instead of correcting her daughter for her behaviour ibcamn 
so is what your saying is bow down to these retarded criminals and follow orders without question and raise our children to be just like you and never question authority and be a slavesucks to be you stopkingobama 
heres an idea dont interfere with the cops when they are trying to arrest someone you fucking creampuff libtard crybabies just dont get it fucking morons think they can adjudicate a case in the streets while the arrest is taking place try protesting real abuse instead of cases like these where morons get what they deserve for being stupid james michael 
you have the right and the duty to stop any sworn servant unlawfully arresting someonethat is an act called aggravated kidnapping and is an act of treason stopkingobama 
you have the right to resist an unlawful arrest they had a warrant for her idiot brothers arrest even resisting an unlawful arrest is a good way to get killed let them cuff you and if they were acting as egregiously as you think they were tell it to the judge if you have video to support your probably unfounded claim all the better 
all you fucking limpwristed cream puff milquetoast libtard cophating social justice warriors with no respect for law and order should just be rounded up and shot or at least sent to iran it would make this country a hell of a lot better off james michael 
resisting and obstructing are non sequiturs for we have nothing because there can be no resisting or obstructing without a real charge to resist or obstructanother aggravated assault and battery kidnapping false imprisonment by a another traitor felon with a badge ten thousand videos of the same exact thing on youtube alonedallas was deserved no cop can be trusted social trending breaking podesta told mills dump all those emails on day news of clintons private email server broke november  "

the bbc has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sexchange drugs 
parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children 
and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue 
but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better 
dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion 
the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience 
cbbc aims to reflect true life providing content that mirrors the lives of as many uk children as possible"
59,"what feminists can learn from melania trump october   ilana mercer 
in recent interviews donald trumps wife melania trump observed wryly that almost every malicious liefilled article about herself or he husband was written by a  female indeed women seem to have a particular stake in bringing mr trump down 
the contrast between mrs trump and the many histrionic shrews prosecuting her husband is stark in both her interviews with cnns condescending anderson cooper and fox newss ainsley earhardt mrs trump was the embodiment of strength 
when a liberal woman declares shes a strong woman usually uttered in a tartlike staccato inflection shes using a cliché look at her actions youll see that strong to liberal distaff means kicking and screaming until she brings others into compliance with her worldview and ways 
a strong liberal woman is one who hammers you about your obligation to forkout for her trojans and her trivora and if birth control fails our liberated libertine then youre on the hook for her abortions and abortifacients and dont dare doubt any of the intemperate charges leveled by this prototype liberal succubus against a man any man to doubt her is to harm her 
it was not without significance that hillary clintons first general election speech in june was before planned parenthood at the time media buried the story of one named rajiv k fernando  who had donated to the clinton foundation and was given a seat as hillarys nuclear weapons advisor watching this i was thinking endemic corruption the  trillion debt the dire jobs report the terrifying prospect of negative interest rates and the fate of savers but hillary and her gynobrigade in media and across the country were cheering for a universal right to taxpayerpaid dilation and curettage dc 
melania trump on the other hand is authentically strong 
in her refusal to impart salacious tellall tidbits to interviewers in the way she guards her privacy and that of her family in her serene gracious and beautiful manners and bearingmrs trump exemplifies a european womans good breeding shes a class act her enemies are the cultural underclass 
nor does mrs trump display any of the histrionics about men exhibited by her american counterparts there are images on the internet of presidents being inappropriate with women in particular you can watch a grainy youtube clip of barack obama appearing to be showing off his crotch to giggling female reporters in another the president with frances nicolas sarkozy is eying the shapely behind of a young woman passing by much to media chagrin melania refused to get worked up about the  access hollywood tape in which her husband engaged in lockerroom talk 
men will be men if theyre not saying it theyre thinking it 
more material than her mien were melania trumps words of reason on the sovietstyle witchhunt launched against her husband with media mediation she said this all sexual assault allegations should be handled in a court of law to accuse someone man or woman without evidence is damaging and unfair this was the exact verdict of famed defense attorney tom mesereau about the bill cosby pileon quit the feeding frenzy give the man his due process investigate the women counseled mesereau esq at the time 
the very embodiment of the malevolent liberal matriarchy rising is the sainted michelle obama the first lady was lauded for an unhinged antitrump address to the nations women in a world where americans have been beheaded on camera women raped en masse on europes streets and christians exterminated in the middle eastthe first lady bewailed being shaken to her shallow core by raunchy words i cant stop thinking about it groaned michelle about mr trumps access hollywood indiscretion it has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted 
the ritualistic decapitation on the altar of a catholic priest by muslim migrants in france thats something i cant stop thinking about the machinegunning of five macys shoppers and employees by a turkish muslim immigrant arcan cetin in my neck of the woods that has shaken me to my core in a way i could not have predicted again mrs obamas pitiful case against mr trump has strengthened nothing but her dramaqueen credentials 
candidate clinton crowed that mrs obamas long whinge for women was a compelling and strong case about the stakes in the election about who we are as americans indeed the implicit case michelle put to women is this a mammoth national debt a shrinking job market rising lawlessness and racial strife an annual intake of mostly thirdworld immigrants exceeding  million the dangers to life and limb of importing more islam fuhgeddaboudit what counts whimpered michelle obama voice tremblingyes mrs obama almost brought herself to tearswas to ferret out microaggression and find a safeplace to hunker down 
as i write sen elizabeth warren has stormed a stage somewhere for hillary clinton phony pocahontas is hollering about the power of nasty women to immiserate clinton and warren make for a resentful domineering powerhungry pair whove made it big in life through the use of state power the human backdrop to their displays of female force invariably looks the same 
whereas trump rallies are packed with hopefilled beaming faces a clintonwarren affair is festooned with malevolentlooking aggrieved women and their frightened lowt houseboys the background music enfeebled squeaking courtesy of a female pop singer like katy perry whose outoftune yelps and bedroom whispers would be unheard if not for the marvel of autotune autotune is the holy grail of recording that corrects intonation problems in vocals or solo instruments in real time without distortion or artifacts it was invented by a male engineer 
shudder 
if this melodramatic neurotic message is the voice of americas womenand legions of republican women have seconded itthen count me with her with melania"

islamic indoctrination is now mandatory in german schools 
from the daily express  
pupils at a primary school were forced to chant allahu akhbar and there is no god but allah an appalled father has claimed 
the father of the pupil at the girls primary school in german ski resort garmischpartenkirchen discovered that his daughter had been forced to learn the islamic prayer when he discovered a handout she had been given 
he claimed she had been forced by teachers to memorise the islamic chants and forwarded the handout to austrian news service unsertirol 
the handout read oh allah how perfect you are and praise be to you blessed is your name and exalted is your majesty there is no god but you 
it had been given to the girl during a lesson in ethics at the bavarian school 
what are they going to teach the ethics of conquest and slavery 
heres another story from yesterday in rt  
parents of a german teenager may face a trial and fine for truancy after refusing to allow their son to go to a local mosque on a school field trip out of fear that it would lead to his indoctrination by islamic radicals 
the story broke in midjune when parents of a yearold student opposed the idea of their son visiting a mosque in the northern german town of rendsburg reportedly organized as part of a geography class 
in a letter to the class teacher quoted by the ndr the teens father argued that his son would be indoctrinated in the mosque he went on to say that for years we have been hearing reports about religiouslymotivated violence connected with islamic people 
a local education authority subsequently fined the couple a total of   referring to school regulations and regional laws which include penalties for truancy 
 alexandra witt alexiastellar october   
when the parents opposed the fine their case was forwarded to peter muellerrakow a local prosecutor who will decide whether or not to proceed with a court trial spiegel reported on wednesday 
the parents lawyer alexander heumann argues that they refused the school trip out of fear for their sons bodily safety 
denying any faithbased motives he emphasized that the couple do not belong to any religious group and are of the opinion that nobody shall be forced into a sacred place against his good will 
school principal renate fritzsche  told ndr that the field trip to the mosque was meant to promote tolerance and diversity 
we also have muslim children with us and muslim parents also know that there are no exceptions she said adding that swimming lessons and sex education are compulsory for muslim children as well it is not the responsibility of the parents to say my child will attend such or such class fritzsche asserted

presidential debates between donald trump and hillary clinton included a third participant vladimir putin standing in the background stealthily inserting himself in the process putins russia uses deniable cyberhooliganism to actively prank the american political system and its taking a toll   this is the putin playbook steal cheat attack disrupt mislead confuse if caught lie and deny and it gets worse 
unfortunately the republican presidential nominee reinforces this narrative referring to a rigged system and an indictable opponent his outbursts follow years of domestic political discord where comity is history crazy seems the new normal and a sitting president can be heckled with you lie 
all told the piece reads like a clinton press release but its actually putins powerful playbook hack steal disrupt mislead confuse in the october  sacramento bee  two days after the comey email bombshell the author is markos kounalakis billed as a senior fellow at central european university and visiting fellow at the hoover institution that doesnt quite capture the man and his connections with the clintons which have shown up in wikileaks 
mr kounalakis author line fails to reveal that he is married to eleni tsakopouloskounalakis daughter of realestate tycoon angelo tsakopoulos according to greek usa reporter  angelo is a top political donor to the clintons as well as the democratic party whose donations to former president bill clinton were rewarded with a night in the prestigious lincoln bedroom in  tsakopoulos confirmed that hillary clinton will seek the democratic nomination in the next presidential election 
angelos daughter eleni a protégé of nancy pelosi and barbara boxer  raised more than  million for hillary clinton in   and that money found its reward on january   us secretary of state hillary clinton swore in tsakopouloskounalakis as us ambassador to hungary in that capacity  she condemned wikileaks for releasing secret diplomatic cables but declined comment on the authenticity of the material tsakopouloskounalakis served as ambassador until  but as wikileaks confirms she continued as a key clinton supporter doing her best to beat back a presidential run by joe biden 
in a june   email eleni tsakopoulos kounalakis tells john podesta that a bay area bagman swears biden is running he said he took him on air force two and hes getting emails last july tsakopouloskounalakis emailed clinton confidant jake sullivan that hrc indicated her view that it would be best to avoid grexit and a july   email to sullivan john podesta and huma abedin she supports terms that will allow greece to stay in the eurozone 
on october   tsakopoulos kounalakis emailed podesta that there is a greek american love fest going on with joe biden very boyclub the same day she emailed podesta and huma abedin that we had a david brock dinner with annie karni from politico she asked to use four quotes from me see attached i told her the first two could be with attribution and the second two without 
as the emails to john podesta and humba abedin reveal ambassador eleni kounalakis as she styles herself remains part of hillary clintons inner circle tellingly the mcclatchytribune newspapers that run her husbands columns do not acknowledge the strong clinton connection 
the new york times proclaimed kounalakis a white knight for rescuing washington monthly  where he served as publisher and teamed with editor paul glastris this tandem made the publication a progressive mustread according to clinton strategist james carville kounalakis reported for newsweek in east germany and ran their bureau in prague he also worked in moscow for nbc radio and mutual news 
kounalakis books include hope is a tattered flag voices for the postbush era  with peter laufer and beyond spin the power of strategic corporate journalism with drew banks and kim daus it remains something of a mystery how the leftist kounalakis became a visiting fellow at the hoover institution known for strong conservative writers and scholars such as thomas sowell victor davis hanson and bruce thornton 
only one time as this writer recalls has kounalakis acknowledged in print his wifes strong clinton connections even after the wikileaks revelations and with a presidential election only days away kounalakis did not acknowledge his wifes key role in hrcs inner circle with john podesta and huma abedin his october  sacramento bee piece suggests markos is right at home in those circles 
kounalakis attacks the republican presidential nominee implying that he is crazy and a tool of the evil putin on the other hand the clinton email scandal gets zero attention and the author piles on the ad copy american society has made great strides in lgbtq rights womens rights and minority rights and has a relatively strong and resilient globally innovative economy 
the author gives readers good cause to regard this article as pure clinton campaign propaganda from a camouflaged clinton crony maybe markos will join his wife huma abedin and john podesta in the wikileaks revelations for many observers the issue is not where the leaks came from but whether the revelations are true and authentic if markos kounalakis believes they are bogus maybe he can write about whats in the real ones"

77,"half of russians fear syria could spark ww  
russia today almost half of all respondents in a recent russian opinion poll said they feared that the aggravation of relations between russia and the west caused by the ongoing crisis in syria could develop into a global military conflict 
the share of those who see the probability of world war three in the near future as high or very high is now at  percent and those who appraise it as low or very low comprise  percent of society the privatelyowned public opinion research center levada reported on monday the remaining  percent of respondents said they couldnt give a simple answer to the question 
when researchers asked citizens if they considered it possible that russia and the west would eventually find a mutually acceptable solution to the crisis  percent answered that this scenario was likely or very likely thirtynine percent evaluate the probability of such an outcome as low or very low and  percent said that they couldnt answer the question 
just over half   percent  of russians said they approve of their countrys involvement in the syrian conflict and  percent said they had a negative or sharply negative attitude to this just under a quarter   percent  couldnt answer the question about their personal view on the subject those who thought that russia should continue the operation and those who thought that airstrikes should be stopped were divided  percent against  percent respectively with  percent finding the question too difficult to answer 
the level of awareness about the situation in syria and the russian air force operation against islamic state is formerly isisisil terrorists there remained fairly high eighteen percent said they were very closely following developments in syria and  percent revealed partial familiarity with the issue just under a fifth   percent  said that they were not interested in news about syria 
a similar poll conducted a year ago by the independent levada center showed that over  percent of russian citizens supported the air operations against is terrorists in syria and almost a half of them agreed that it was right for russia to support the government of syrias democraticallyelected president bashar assad 
a different poll conducted earlier this month by the staterun research center vtsiom showed that  percent of russians believed that western criticism of the air forces counterterrorism operation in aleppo syria was ungrounded and prejudiced only  percent said the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the russian military have some basis in reality 
russia first deployed an air force contingent in syria in  after receiving a request for military help from the syrian government which is currently battling islamic state and affiliated groups russian war planes began launching airstrikes on terrorists in syria on september   their work has aided the syrian military in achieving considerable success in driving jihadist forces out of the country"

according to a report in the new yorker james comey  big kahuna of the fbi went fullon cowboy in releasing details of the new clinton email inquiry apparently the department of justice advised him not to release the information just days before the presidential election 
gosh i wonder if the same advice would have been given if it was donald trump who was being investigated by the fbi 
comey explained his decision in a letter to fbi employees  
we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations but here i feel an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record 
the doj  and by doj i mean attorney general loretta lynch  who famously had a secret meeting on an airport tarmac with bill clinton to talk about her nonexistent grandchildren  is implying that comey is not playing fair and that the move is inconsistent with the rules which have been designed to make it seem like they are not interfering in an election 
heres comeys letter to the senate judiciary committee 
really 
the doj thinks that the public shouldnt know that the person they may be voting for is being investigated by the fbi 
thats the most absurd thing i have heard for quite some time and considering this election thats really saying something 
this is from the new yorker report emphasis mine 
on friday james comey the director of the federal bureau of investigation acting independently of attorney general loretta lynch  sent a letter to congress saying that the fbi had discovered emails that were potentially relevant to the investigation of hillary clintons private server coming less than two weeks before the presidential election comeys decision to make public new evidence that may raise additional legal questions about clinton was contrary to the views of the attorney general according to a wellinformed administration official lynch expressed her preference that comey follow the departments longstanding practice of not commenting on ongoing investigations and not taking any action that could influence the outcome of an election but he said that he felt compelled to do otherwise  
comeys decision is a striking break with the policies of the department of justice according to current and former federal legal officials comey who is a republican appointee of president obama has a reputation for integrity and independence but his latest action is stirring an extraordinary level of concern among legal authorities who see it as potentially affecting the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections  source  is this investigation the iceberg to hrcs titanic campaign 
hillary clinton has said she finds the development unprecedented and deeply troubling source  
oh ill bet she does 
ill bet if trump had been the target of the investigation she would have been up on the stage gripping the podium to stay upright  saying how wonderful it was that comey decided to break the news so that voters could be aware that they might be voting for someone who was suspected of having broken federal laws ill bet shed be saying that the public has a right to know if a candidate was under investigation ill bet shed take the high road and say that those elected to the office of president of the united states have to be above and beyond reproach 
of course when its her things are a little different arent they 
we do have a right to know we absolutely have a right to know that a person who could be elected to know all of the secrets was careless when she only knew some of the secrets it seems like a nobrainer that the public should know that a candidate is being investigated for a second time for being criminally negligent with information entrusted to her 
and the fact that we know has severely damaged clintons campaign although previous polls were incredibly skewed to the point of being outright fake  it looks like the mainstream is now trying to save face with a new batch of polls a poll from abc news and the washington post  both hotbeds of liberal voters has shown that her lead has dropped to within a single point over donald trump due to the clinton email scandal 
about a third of likely voters say theyre less likely to support clinton given fbi director james comeys disclosure friday that the bureau is investigating more emails related to its probe of clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state  
finally some people are actually paying attention to the character of hillary clinton 
but it may not be enough there was one finding that was astonishing to me even though it probably shouldnt be 
given other considerations  percent say it makes no difference 
meanwhile on social media the fbi emails are somehow not a trending topic it certainly appears that twitter facebook snapchat and buzzfeed are blacking out the topic my biggest question is this why now 
why did james comey who has probably committed career suicide along with a potential actual suicide via a shot to the back of his own head like others who have run afoul of the clintons feel the need to break the news particularly after giving her a pass during the last investigation 
opponents will jump on the fact that hes a republican and will say that he did it for political reasons 
they wont admit that perhaps he felt guilty for being complicit in letting her off the hook in the first investigation into the clinton email negligence 
they will never ever admit that maybe his integrity and belief in the office he holds made it impossible for him to keep quiet until after the election and that perhaps when he was given a chance to right a previous wrong he took it clinton isnt taking it gracefully 
clintons complaints which have appeared in the press around the world make her look even worse than she did before 
this is from the telegraph  a uk publication 
hillary clinton was furiously fighting to keep her presidential bid on track on saturday night as her lead in the polls narrowed after the fbis bombshell announcement that it had reopened its investigation into her emails 
james comey announced on friday afternoon that fresh evidence had emerged for his investigation into whether mrs clinton was criminally negligent in her handling of classified material 
on saturday the latest poll of polls by tracker site realclearpolitics put clinton  percentage points ahead of the republican nationwide down from  points just  days previously 
but wait  it gets better 
the clinton campaign has responded with what amounts to a declaration of open warfare against mr comey alleging that his actions are backed by a political motive and mrs clinton herself called the decision unprecedented and deeply troubling 
its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election she complained addressing cheering supporters at a rally in the mustwin state of florida 
democrats questioned the timing of the agencys decision which comes as polls showed mrs clintons lead falling just  days before the presidential election 
this is like an wheeler smacking into us and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time said donna brazile the chairwoman of the democratic national committee 
the campaign is trying to cut through the noise as best it can 
we dont want it to knock us off our game but on the secondtolast weekend of the race we find ourselves having to tell voters keep your focus keep your eyes on the prize 
hillarys campaign manager sounds pretty desperate to me as for the complaints from hrc they just make her sound like the outoftouch moneygrabbing powerhungry deceitful"

humas husband anthony weiner which blows the whole humaislam meme into the gutter all we are seeing with this is the fact the muslims running saudi arabia are crypto jews  anyway  hillary was so sure shed never be called to account with her emails that she was careless enough to have them end up on weiners personal laptop in a file he titled life insurance 

well you know how the entire establishment is wrapped up in child sex and other similar crimes and weiner ended up getting his laptop seized by the nypd in a kiddie pornchild sex investigation when the nypd went through the laptop they found hillarys emails in full unadulterated pristine form they proved crimes of the highest order  at least  felonies found so far with a majority of them related to treason and selling out the country 

so the nypd opened up a case on hillary the fbi said no well take that  and that is the only reason why these investigations got reopened because if the nypd handled it huge portions of the fbi would be sent to prison now the fbi is under pressure to actually do its job because they know the nypd knows no matter what the outcome the fbi gains zero  zero credibility points from this 

so read my report do not forgive  it was bang on they did this because they had to not because they had any intention at all of being good and it really is time to drain the swamp 

now lets all sit and wait for the suicide of preet bharara  the us prosecuting attorney for the southern district of new york and the nypd who pushed this into the light hes now a target of the fbi the dnc the clinton death machine and god knows what else prediction and i do not make predictions the director of investigations for the nypd will commit suicide within  days hes a walking dead man 

the circle of crime in washington dc is so entrenched and so intertwined that if you poke one part of it there is a good chance the whole show will fall apart poking that monster in a way that hurts is something i do not believe anyone will survive preet might as well call himself a zombie 

the nypd trumped the fbi that is why they had to investigate hillary 

well well the nypd is what busted the hillary mails open while they were looking for kiddie stuff on weiners laptop and that is why the fbi was forced to investigate hillary they had no choice nypd trumps fbi

the complaints noted that the machines wrongly identified a voters choice but in all reported cases the voters were able to correct their ballots before casting them 
to my knowledge at this point we dont have any cases where elections officials noted significant problems with any machines based on these complaints of course theyre all looked into and thats why we encourage people to immediately flag down an election official commented gannon 
the nc state board of election released the following statement regarding the complaints 
the nc state board of elections is aware that some voters have contacted advocacy groups or elections officials with concerns about touchscreen voting machines in several counties 
similar reports have been made in recent elections and we take them very seriously 
we want to ensure voters that safeguards are in place to ensure touchscreen machines accurately record voters selections 
touchscreen machines are tested thoroughly before each election they are recalibrated daily before voting begins to test and ensure accuracy if a voter notices an issue with selection accuracy of a machine they should raise their hand and notify an election official immediately if needed the machine may be taken out of service for recalibration and the voter may be moved to a different machine 
also each touchscreen machine prompts voters to review their selections before casting their ballot as with paper ballots voters should check over their selections to ensure accuracy prior to casting their ballot on touchscreen machines voters also can review a realtime audit log that records all of their selections 
we urge all voters to carefully review their selections before casting their ballots and to immediately report any questions or concerns to elections officials said kim westbrook strach executive director of the nc state board of elections"

gop presidential nominee donald trump has taken a ridiculously hardline  and even bigoted  stance on immigration he has promised to build a wall and force mexico to pay for it and he has said that he will erect deportation forces to root out and get rid of all people in the united states without proper documentation well as we already knew it turns out that the donald is the ultimate hypocrite on this one 
according to the associated press  it turns out that donald trumps wife melania violated immigration laws by working illegally in the united states when she first arrived from her native slovenia melania often modeled using just her first name and was first granted entry into the country on a visitors visa known as a bb visa this occurred on august   melania did not get a legal work visa until october   during the time when she was prohibited from working in the country melania made money on ten different modeling assignments totaling upwards of  she got a green card in  and became a naturalized citizen in  
so in other words melania trump lied about her immigration story as recently as thursday when she once again touted how a million percent legal immigration is the only way to go and that this is how she did it melania said in part in her stump speech 
as a young entrepreneur i wanted to follow my dream to a place where freedom and opportunity were in abundance so of course i came here living and working in america was a true blessing but i wanted something more i wanted to be an american 
well it appears that as has long been suspected that melania trump wasnt as kosher in her immigration and work practices as she claims the information obtained by the ap include but are not limited to her contract from metropolitan international management  a modeling agency also theres the ledgers from the agency which is no longer in business that shows melania working during the time when she had the visitors visa but no work visa it seems to be a complicated story full of many attempts to cover up melanias wrongdoing but it is certainly quite interesting this would be why melania trump never released actual records regarding her initial immigration to the united states and her eventual path to citizenship while it is unlikely that her citizenship is at risk it certainly means that she committed immigration fraud you can read more here at the associated press  
the long and short of it is this donald trump launched his crazy bid for the presidency preying on the fears of the other namely immigrants that is the height of hypocrisy seeing as how his own wife didnt completely comply with immigration law hopefully this story and the many other lies and coverups and shady dealings surrounding the trump campaign break through the hypnotism that the demagogue has spun onto so many desperate citizens of this great country and they figure out that they are falling for the biggest con of all time

a truancy report can lead to a home check by sheriffs deputies or police and possibly the arrest of the parents tv station wjhg reported

before the leaked tape of donald trump describing his propensity to grab women by the pussy to billy bush it seemed that the media was ignoring donald trumps glaring faults as a presidential candidate during the primaries  for example he received far more positive media coverage than any of his competitors it turns out there might be a reason for that  trump was bribing the media  at least thats the accusation being made by megyn kelly of fox news 
in her memoire settle for more which will be released this week kelly said that trump likely received the infamous question in which she asked about the fact that he has called women fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals that question set trump off on one of his twitter tirades these are only a portion 
the worst and most controversial of which was this 
as the election progressed it became more and more apparent that trump expected that no matter how egregious his behavior he expected no demanded that the media kiss his orange ass if they didnt he would cut off access but before that he tried bribery 
while kelly couldnt speak for other members of the media she alleges that trump attempted to buy positive coverage by offering free stays at his hotels with full perks while the attempt clearly didnt work on kelly she says that with some their loyalty came cheap or perhaps not so cheap 
this is actually one of the untold stories of the  campaign i was not the only journalist to whom trump offered gifts clearly meant to shape coverage kelly said he also attempted to woo them with praise she said adding this is smart because the media is full of people whose egos need stroking 
trump tried to work the refs and some of the refs responded she said 
when it became obvious that some reporters were in the tank for trump she alleges in one chapter certain tv hosts would work with the candidate in advance on occasional trump criticism so they would appear unbiased she didnt identify them by name or media outlet 
source yahoo 
kelly also asserts that the day before the debate in which kelly asked about trumps treatment of women the candidate called fox news exec bill sammon who told him about the first question all we heard about though during the election was that it was hillary clinton who was fed a town hall debate question and it was hardly earth shattering the insider knowledge said that a woman in the flint michigan debate would ask a question about the flint water  
while bribing journalists isnt illegal per say it is highly unethical without the fourth estate exposing the underbelly of politicians and of politics democracy is impossible

september   has come and gone countless bodies lie scattered in fragments around where two of the countrys tallest skyscrapers once stood some have burned to ash others had their throats slashed by islamic terrorists still others fought and died on a plane to prevent another islamic terror attack from taking place 
but joe has an idea joe is a guy with lots of big ideas and this one is a real doozy 
the senator from delaware has come a long way since his days as a sixties shyster drumming up business in wilmington his formerly bald head is covered in hair so shiny is gleams under neon lights his teeth are capped and shine almost as brightly after a generation holding down a squeaky seat in the senate seniority makes him a man to be reckoned with and therefore a man to be listened to 
even if you wish he would shut up 
im groping here joe says for once he isnt referring to his notorious habits with women that will go on to make him the star of countless viral photographs massaging squeezing caressing instead hes talking about foreign policy the chair of the senate foreign relations committee has no clue 
joe is worried that the muslims will think badly of us after they murdered thousands of us and he has a plan to make them feel better 
seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for  million to iran senator joe biden says 
the remark isnt quite as random as it seems the senator from delaware a state not known for its large muslim or iranian population has a friendly relationship with the iran lobby that relationship will only grow friendlier during the bush era as he attacks america and appeases its enemies 
iranianamericans who hate the jihadist government that has taken over their country and oppressed the persian people are outraged when he attends a fundraiser at a proiranian lobbyists home in california while treasonously attacking his own government for naming iran one of the members of the axis of evil 
joes usual amtrak obsession wouldnt get him in the door in california but treason hair plugs and capped teeth make him a big hit outside delaware and joe remains very fond of iran 
he informs israeli officials that israel will have to reconcile itself with the nuclearization of iran and thats all the way back in  before the deal that puts iran on the path to a shiite bomb was a nuclear twinkle in obamas eye and a radioactive itch in hillarys socks 
that was a big year for biden it was his first and biggest shot at the big chair in the white house joe had tried it in  and was stomped by dukakis of all people after being caught plagiarizing a speech by british politician neil kinnock  got him a useless position in the white house as a consolation prize 
this time around joe biden is expected to get the same consolation prize from hillary clinton that she got from barack obama the office of secretary of state of the united states 
of all the jobs that joe biden wants and is utterly unfit for amtrak train engineer secret agent and the guy in charge of counting all the money at the bar its hard to think of one that hes less fit for 
joe biden blamed darfur on the gingrich revolution he fell in love with the taliban 
the taliban per se is not our enemy joe insisted there is not a single statement that the president has ever made in any of our policy assertions that the taliban is our enemy 
he suggested that  of the taliban were probably okay and only  were incorrigible most of the taliban he seemed to think were like joe biden just in it for the money 
but joe biden has a soft spot for islamic terrorists whether theyre the shiite jihadists of iran or the sunni jihadists of the taliban joe loves all the terrorists of the world and the terrorists love him back 
it wasnt that long ago that we were being lectured to by the media on bushs ruination of relations with the rest of the world if biden were to become secretary of state he would become the third democratic presidential campaign loser to get the job as a consolation prize for his failures as a politician the last time a professional held down the job would have been the bush administration 
and yet perversely each loser secretary has been more incompetent than the last hillarys disastrous time as secretary of state could only be exceeded by john kerry who gave away everything to the russians and who was contradicted by the white house so many times it would have humiliated a lesser man or just any man the only loser who could follow two class acts like that was joe biden 
joe bidens amateur diplomacy has been one disaster after another even his visit to israel a friendly ally not known for fractious political visits by american politicians became an international incident with biden sulking in his room while hillary yelled at prime minister netanyahu for  minutes over the phone but somehow biden with his gift for appeasing iran and the taliban alienates allies 
just this year joe biden launched yet another attack on israel a cynic might almost think that tehran joe loves islamic terrorists and hates those who resist them and fight against them 
biden has claimed that terrorism is not an existential threat he accused president bush of being shortsighted for using the military to fight islamic terrorists he argued that the perception that we want to stay in iraq helps al qaeda some years later his administrations decision to pull out led to the rise of isis he called for closing gitmo while insisting that it had become the greatest propaganda tool that exists for recruiting of terrorists around the world 
senator joe biden was a voice for appeasement vice president joe biden was part of an administration that empowered and unleashed the malignant power of islamic terror secretary of state joe biden would be able to act out his worst fantasies he could even write that check to iran though the obamabiden era has seen cash transfers to iran that make joes  million check seem like chump change 
hillary clintons rise doesnt just mean that she will be making big decisions it will mean that joe biden will have gone from a wilmington shyster to running the foreign policy of a country he has betrayed"

wednesday november   tags deep state  clinton cartel  damning evidence naturalnews my fellow americans we are watching history unfold before us with such sound and fury that we are likely to never witness comparable events again in our lifetime as of today i am now convinced that the deep state has turned on hillary clinton and will unveil damning evidence in the next few days that will end the clintons reign of terror over america and collapse her bid for the presidencythe mainstream media of course will never report this news for the simple reason that they are the propaganda arm of the criminal clinton cartel as such they will lie to the public to the bitter end even as the clinton titanic sinks with all of them on board in deep frigid waters no less with no more lifeboats to be foundthe socalled deep state  the powerful insiders who really run the intelligence services and inner layers of untouchable bureaucracy  has decided hillary clinton is too damaged to defend any longer  even if she were to win by stealing the election she would be so mired in criminal investigations and political illegitimacy that she would rip the nation to shreds while fighting for her own political survivalit has now been decided i believe that hillary clinton will be taken out of power by releasing criminally damaging emails which have long been held by the nsa and fbi this will likely happen before the coming weekend once that is accomplished the next goal will be to wait for president trump to take office then destroy the us economy through a controlled global debt collapse so that trump can be blamed for the near collapse of western economies remember the deep state isnt protrump theyre still all about defending the establishment but hillary is one bridge too far for even the statists to stomachinstead of allowing hillary clinton to take power and destroy america from the top in other words deep state power brokers have reverted to plan b which is to let trump take the white house then destroy america through the controlled demolition of its currency and economy this is simpler than it sounds bringing down the debt pyramid of a nation carrying nearly  trillion in national debt isnt exactly rocket science all they have to do is stand back and stop manipulating the markets and stop printing new money for a few months while raising interest rates monetary gravity will do the restin the mean time hillary clinton and a long list of her coconspirators are going to find themselves charged with obstruction of justice  lying under oath destruction of evidence conspiracy corruption and other serious charges that will lead to serious prison time for manythe criminal racket of the clintons is about to implode the participants will be charged under the rico act for racketeering activities for which ample evidence already exists a new video from steve pieczenik describes some of this in this video intelligence insider steve pieczenik lays out how highlevel intelligence insiders are now working in concert to reverse the clinton coup thats attempting to take over america and destroy it from withineven if you dont believe pieczenik  and i fully realize hes controversial in his own way  this short video is a very important must watch explanation to know what people in the intelligence community are doing weve initiated a countercoup the clintons are going to go full murder in a last ditch desperate effort to save themselves beware of what may yet unfold in the coming days like a cornered wild animal the clintons are extremely dangerous when they realize they have nothing to lose by going full murder in an attempt to save themselvesi will not be surprised the least bit if bodies of people in high places start piling up over the next week watch for news reports of mysterious car crashes swimming pool accidents or natural deaths involving people like james comey whod better have armed security personnel around him at all timeslook for desperate measures such as the clintons attempting to blackmail obama comey or anyone who they think might serve as leverage to save their own skins we might also see desperate false flag attacks unfold in the next few days although thats increasingly unlikely since it seems the clintons are now on their own they would need the assistance of obama to pull off another sandy hook you see a deal has already been struck with obama most likely deep state operatives have already struck a deal with obama to avoid prosecuting him for his own serious crimes as long as he stays out of the way as hillary clintons head is served up on a platter this likely explains why obama is now publicly saying he trusts comey and refuses to go to bat for hillary theres no love lost between obama and the clintons remember as all this is going down the propaganda ministry of the clinton regime  cnn nyt washington post etc  is going to explode into an allout batst crazy conspiracy theory phase where they blame the russians extraterrestrials bigfoot and the loch ness monster for everything thats imploding around the clintons mainstream media news reports are going to increasingly sound like sociopathic babble from crazy people grasping at whatever outlandish theories they can invoke maybe crop circles were created by the russians as a secret code to wikileaks and donald trump ehmeanwhile conspiratorial operatives like george stephanopoulos fully realize they are probably going to jail for collusion and sedition  so they have nothing left to lose by desperately trying to put hillary in the white house via any means at their disposal including totally faking negative news against donald trump which is of course the entire news mission of cnn at this point a disgraced propaganda network run by antiamerican traitors if the vote is stolen for hillary clinton all hell breaks loose should the globalist soros operators manage to steal the vote bribe the electoral voters or rig the black box voting machines sufficiently to place hillary clinton in the white house all hell breaks loose across america  the fbi goes into full indictment mode to push criminal charges for the clinton criminal regime donald trump launches a massive legal challenge to the election outcome dispatching an army of lawyers to level a vast assortment of charges involving coordinated voter fraud the rigging of voting machines the attempted bribery of electoral voters and so on the us military revs up its plans for an armed military coup to depose clinton and restore democracy this one should be especially entertaining to watch unfold if it gets activated and yes you will beg for a shortterm military dictatorship as long as they promise to depose clinton and restore open fair and free elections armed us citizens prepare for a massive march on washington to take back their democracy and restore a lawful society where the political elite dont get away with corruption fraud and murder expect this march to be joined by police officers and federal law enforcement officials of all kinds the nsa likely goes into full dump mode to unleash every scrap of damning criminal evidence against hillary clinton this will likely be joined by cia assets who already have the goods on the clintons and their lolita express pedo joy rides wikileaks anonymous and every former nsa analyst goes into destroy the clintons mode and begins to hack and expose every last shred of email evidence ever possessed by the clintons and anyone close to them anonymous alone has enough technical clout to accomplish this with little or no outside help i expect kim dotcom to be aiding this entire effort as well as he rightly holds extreme hatred toward hillary clinton as do we all come to think of it the establishment republicans in the us congress will as usual meekly surrender to the democrats pulls down their britches and bend over to prepare to take it in the rear because thats what they do best when the going gets tough totally useless politicrats like john mccain cant get their pants around their ankles quickly enough when democrats start accusing them of something these useless heaps of human baggage will be tossed out of washington as the revolution unfolds replaced with individuals who actually honor the us constitution like rep louie gohmert i root for all groups working to save america and expose the criminal politicians bring out the marshmallows and weiners folks this is going to be the most bizarre campfire front row seat to us history that anyone has witnessed in over  years try not to trip and face plant into the flames as all this unfolds it might be a smart idea to have some preparedness supplies at the ready since no one really knows just how nasty this is all going to get and thank god hillary doesnt have her fingers on the nuclear launch codes or shed probably launch them just to change the narrativeas for me im with anybody whos trying to save america  restore democracy and throw the establishment criminals in prison like almost everybody else ive had enough of the lies the corruption the media deceptions and the incessant blood sucking parasites in washington dc who are too arrogant and stupid to realize just how much theyre universally despised the revolution is on anonymous wikileaks project veritas the fbi and the nsa have all been activated theres no stopping them now and all the details of all the crimes of the clintons are about to spill onto the stage of history dirty deeds and allbe warned you are probably not psychologically prepared for the truth about what the clintons really are you will probably vomit health ranger approved aquatru water filter back in stock

94,"obamas secret muslim list why enemies of israel and irans goto guy appeared on the list november   daniel greenfield 
daniel greenfield a shillman journalism fellow at the freedom center is a new york writer focusing on radical islam 
like a warped islamic version of santa claus obama had a secret muslim list and his people checked it at least twice the list was of muslims who were prospects for important jobs and appointments 
it included a muslim who had described israel as an apartheid state irans goto guy in new york financial circles and a number of figures linked to the muslim brotherhood 
it was the ultimate religious test from an administration that had vocally rejected them 
obama had claimed that having religious tests for migration was shameful and not american 
when i hear folks say that well maybe we should just admit the christians but not the muslims he huffed from turkey his muslim host country was run by a bigoted sponsor of islamic terror 
we dont have religious tests he insisted 
except we did and we do obama also had religious tests his religious tests excluded christians and favored muslims that is why his syrian refugees were between  and  muslim with only  christians and  yazidis even though both groups are real victims of the muslim religious war 
syria is  christian and hundreds of thousands have been displaced yet only  have made it past obamas iron curtain thats either an islamic religious test or the worlds greatest coincidence 
but would the man who piously lectured us on the evils of religious tests really have a religious test 
of course he would 
the hacked emails include a list of muslim american candidates for top administration jobs subcabinet jobs and outside boardsagenciespolicy committees 
the list was sent to john podesta who headed the obamabiden transition project it had been put together by a woman who had sat on the commission on international religious freedom but boasted that she had excluded those with some arab american background but who are not muslim eg george mitchell many lebanese americans for example are christian 
how shameful how not american of barack hussein obama 
most who are listed appear to be muslimamerican except that a handful where noted may be arab american but of uncertain religion esp christian she assured podesta 
religious tests are only out of line when they exclude muslims not when they exclude christians 
thats the pattern which emerged from the obamabiden transition project and obamas refugee policy there has been a clear pattern of administration bias against christians and jews and in favor of muslims that bias has been obvious in a foreign policy which backed islamic supremacist groups such as the muslim brotherhood over more moderate governments at the expense of nonmuslim populations 
this policy led to the displacement and death of countless christians and the persecution of entire communities by an administration which then denied safe harbor to the victims of its own policies 
administration bias replicated that same bigoted policy at home when it favored islamic candidates 
obama appointed farooq kathwari the first name on the muslim list sent to podesta to the presidents advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders 
the muslim list email had warned that kathwaris then yearold americaneducated son irfan aka imran was killed in  fighting jihad against the russians in afghanistan the actions of his son who may have been with the mujahedeen but was also apparently outraged over indias defense of kashmir is of less relevance than kathwaris appearance at an isna conference and another conference cosponsored by the muslim students association both groups are linked to the muslim brotherhood 
he cochaired the american muslim task force whose members included salam almarayati  director of the muslim public affairs council which has defended hamas and hezbollah yahya basha president of the american muslim council and a former board member of the muslim public affairs council and assorted other islamists  its report complained that muslims were inhibited from donating to charities run by islamic terrorist groups such as hezbollah yahya basha also appeared on obamas muslim list 
also listed was mpacs aslam abdullah who had claimed that zionists christians and hindus were behind the war on terror he had described israel as an apartheid state and a racist state 
the second muslim on the list cyrus amirmokri was named assistant treasury secretary he became the first iranian to be named to such a high position and defended the iran nuclear sellout mokri attended a meeting with members of the iran lobby at the white house he also reportedly advised obama on iranian sanctions 
obama had famously told nasa boss bolden that one of his three tasks at the space agency was muslim selfesteem but bolden almost didnt make it in the muslim list included two alternative candidates for nasa administrator one of them dr charles elachi of jpl was dismissed as possibly christian indeed elachi who grew up admiring john wayne and believes that american success is possible because it isnt held back by the longstanding ingrained systems and beliefs found in the middle east would have been a rather poor fit but it is deeply shameful and unamerican that his potential nasa appointment questioned his religion that is an inappropriate religious test that obama must apologize for 
the other name on the list however is firouz naderi an iranian board member of the public affairs alliance of iranian americans which advocated in support of the iran nuke sellout 
eboo patel whose name would frequently appear on lists of islamists in the obama administration first made an appearance on the muslim list despite his islamist ties he got the posting at the advisory council on faithbased neighborhood partnerships also listed were keith ellison andre carson and larry shaw shaw sits on the board of cair 
dilawar syed the first name to appear on the list of possible appointments was named to obamas advisory commission on asian americans and pacific islanders syed is a cofounder and chair of the asian americans and pacific islander victory fund which has come out for hillary clinton the secret muslim list describes him as animated by policy issues relating to the muslim world a similar description is appended to the bio for kashif zafar who served as a cochair of the south asian american leadership council at the dnc 
also on the list was hamid biglari bloomberg described biglari as irans man in new york and as the iranian presidents goto guy in new york financial circles biglari was a key iran lobby figure 
the recently revealed secret muslim list is deeply troubling there should be no religious test for political appointments yet obama had one and his people sought to screen out christians and favor muslims 
this represents behavior that is in obamas own words shameful and not american one cant help but conclude that based on his own principles obama is shameful and not american"
95,"soros  his connection to the riots k shares by dml daily  november    crazy left  
the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that the protests spreading throughout the country are peaceful and represent the widespread hatred for presidentelect donald trump unfortunately the media is pushing a false narrative 
fact is theses are not protests according to the law the events taking place are riots under federal law a riot is a public disturbance involving an act of violence by one or more persons assembled in a group of at least three people inciting a riot applies to a person who organizes encourages or participates in a riot it can apply to one who urges or instigates others to riot according to  uscs   to incite a riot or  to organize promote encourage participate in or carry on a riot includes but is not limited to urging or instigating other persons to riot 
george soros the radical left leaning billionaire who supported hillary clinton and donates to radical groups such as black lives matter and moveonorg is behind the riots and needs to be held accountable the majority of people showing up to these riots are paid to do so by sorosfundedgroups

cnn anchor hala gorani wasnt expecting her network to be called the clinton news network by british firebrand conservative columnist katie hopkins from the daily mail and watching the ensuing implosion is a mustsee 
hopkins first offense was daring to believe donald trump is going to win the election  never a good way to start on cnn 
i think hes going to win i think you guys are in for a big surprise which im quite excited about i think weve seen a very similar think here in the uk with brexit we saw a lot of the liberal press kind of sneering at brexiteers we saw a lot of the sneering that we see from the clinton news network 
thats cnn youre calling us the clinton news network gorani said in shock 
youre exactly correct hopkins said 
the two argued over how the media are obsessed with polls especially the ones showing hillary clinton in the lead hopkins destroyed gorani saying having sat in the republican national convention in cleveland and watched your news network it is entirely biased i think in coverage 
gorani refused to believe and said over her year career at cnn shes only seen nothing but balance at the network 
oddly enough as the sparring match continued gorani repeatedly cut hopkins off when she criticized the clintons

during an arizona speech delivered in spanish sen tim kaine cheered the demographic transformation of the united states caused by the nations federal immigration policies telling his latino audience on thursday you are the future of america 
by  communities of color will represent the majority of our population kaine said so of course latinos will help shape the future of america because you are the future of america

yet during his remarks kaine laid out how a clinton administration plans to hasten the demographic transformation through expansive immigration policies that would essentially bring about the dissolution of national borders  kaine explained how a clintonkaine administration would end family detention close private detention facilities freeze deportations and would give citizenshipand by extension voting privileges and access to federal benefitsto the illegal population 
kaine also doubled down on his pledge to expand president obamas executive amnesty

99,"european media jihad against geert wilders as they lose their grip the political and media elites are getting desperate november   robert spencer 
the mainstream media in western europe and north america isnt even pretending to be an objective news source anymore instead journalists are working openly to quell what looks increasingly on both sides of the atlantic like a popular revolution against the hegemony of the selfappointed political and media aristocracy that seems hellbent on driving western civilization over the cliff and so its time for another round of their twominutes hate against dutch politician and freedom fighter geert wilders 
wilders has yet again gone on trial in the netherlands for hate speech and this time the case against him is especially flimsy as europe is roiled by the criminal activity of muslim migrants he is being accused of hate speech for saying that the massive influx of immigrants from morocco from which most of the muslim migrants in the netherlands come has to be stopped 
this trial could very easily backfire on the dutch inquisitors and make wilders more popular than ever with the people of the netherlands and europe in general as they are increasingly fed up with the political and media elites forcing them to accept a massive influx of muslim migrants that ensures a future only of civil strife bloodshed and sharia oppression 
consequently those elites are trying desperately to shore up their position wilders chanted no more moroccans at a rally the horror to any sane person this means stop the influx of moroccan immigrants who only inflate crime rates and welfare rolls to the media which at this point is quite insane insofar as insanity means an inability or refusal to accept reality this means genocide 
and so in this deutsche welle dw piece by freelance journalist teri schultz were told that european parliament lawmaker cecile kyenge who was born in congo had numerous racial slurs  not to mention bananas literally  thrown at her along with suggestions she go back to her country does this have anything to do with the crime and civil strife that are the foundations for wilders position of course not but wilders schultz tells us is of course farright that allpurpose and meaningless semaphore that serves only to signal to rightthinking deutsche welle readers that wilders is as far as the media elites are concerned unsavory and must be opposed and shunned his positions left unexamined 
schultz contacted me to serve as the villain of her piece being sure to tell her hapless readers that i am known for extreme antiislam views to make sure that if any of them are foolish enough to find themselves agreeing with me they will immediately reverse themselves and get their minds right the term extreme also since the western governing class unanimously refers to jihad terrorists as extremists also implies that i am a terrorist 
after the article came out i challenged schultz on this she replied i dont think even you would consider your views mainstream do you i responded absolutely yes my views were the broad mainstream in the western world from  ad until the s what changed not islamic teaching to that she said okay youd have to argue it with another expert which i am not but thanks again for contributing indeed she is just a mouthpiece for the views the political and media elites want us to hold 
in any case schultzs article merely reveals the desperation of the ruling class and the selfappointed opinionshapers they can call those of us who wish to defend the people and culture of europe and north america farright and extreme every day and they do but the public can see with their eyes what is happening wilders popularity isnt growing because he is a charming fellow which is of course not to say that he isnt its growing because he speaks the truths that the political and media elites are in a frenzy to obscure 
and its only going to get worse for them the brexit vote and the trump candidacy whether he wins or loses shows that their hegemony is beginning to be challenged those challenges will continue and grow they will before too long be decisively voted out and repudiated"

102,"i am a rock n roll nigger httpsyoutubegsovftvlrk daniel w mccullar 
as a mix blood american any time i hear someone in the black community use the n word in any way or form i hear and see ignorance when i hear someone outside the black community use it i see nothing less than a disease spreading it is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable no other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a bullshit juvenile excuse jay 
thanks for the comment my nigga guy 
although i am not hispanic i understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years  
you would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about blacks and whites including thouse who come from other countries in south america as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance  
we as the white race dont have anywhere near the market cornered as to racial predigest and racism in general just ask the jews or palestinians about that  
we just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from  mr 
she said the in n word on facebook bet she dont have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks n word that dont offend us you wanna know y u dont have to be black to be call a n word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think its cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world guy 
so what do you consider a white honkey or cracker to be  considering i was one who watched the original archie bunker and gladys shows and thought they were great i never liked gov wallace and thought what the cops did in selma alabama and little rock was just wrong  i have always believed mr king was right while thinking that sharpton and jackson are in it just for the money and political opportunities and believe the the blm has done some good but has been hijacked by out side influence that sees political gain to be won on the behalf of hillary who i think will absolutely destroy the intercitys by keeping herself and her kind in power over the backs of african americans and others she deems deporables  mr 
im not racist im jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with black lives matters  then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them kkk if not all police is the biggest gang of america they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we dont own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period mr 
further more fuck jessie jackson im from greenville to he aint did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn sc an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that guy 
mr just about every black man woman and child in n s carolina knows that justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail in just about every southern state in the south that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth  
now we as the whites have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist to the point of having a black president to make it look legit for the world to see  
what do you suppose president putin sees when he shakes hands with obama just a man or a black man  
personally i belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years out of all races including white and black  
i just dont act upon my inherited prejudice nor choose to pass it on to my children 
i think that is what makes the difference realizing its there but choosing not to act on the difference is what separates me from the others who just make lip service to there ingrained predigest while knowing full well they dont believe a word that comes out of there mouths  
when i see you i see a black man who is just as frail or strong as i am wanting the same as i do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it  
if on the other hand if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger it dosent matter you will be treated as such  mr 
you right i never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way i see things my way i know u not racist u know im not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me  bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random do u think its right with out the proper cause guy 
no i dont think i want to live were you do considering i am too damn old and set in my ways to want to besides i dont think my wife is going to want to move quite yet  my oldest son moved to alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot both got good jobs and doing well even bought a house on a acre of land for about half of what you would pay for one around one here in the san francisco bay area 
brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about  people when i was a kid growing up here my family have been farming for generations the hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps and the blacks were shown the city limit lines by the police  
my mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named pearly live with us for many years durring the summers while mom ran the ranch i loved her much she was a good woman as wide as she was tall would read to me and my sister and made incredible apple pies i first meet her when i was  living in richmond ca to when we moved here in the mid s into the house my mom built that i still live in today pearlys children came to my sisters wedding 
now brentwood is a city of  i dont recognise it any longer but its core is still farming there are black families living on my street in houses built where there were once orchards and going to the schools i did i have a family i would consider white trailer trash living in the house next door that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties  
my attitude is people are people i really dont give a damn who you are be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me  we can be friends and neighbors sharing a beer at a barbecue i throw on july th and at christmas and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat  
as to the other thing you mentioned i think about cops being randomly nosey asking about me because i was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood  what fucking business is it of his  if he asked me i would politely tell him to go f off and then shut the hell up f he pushed it there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his chief and maybe the city counsel as well depending on the situation  its not a good idea to piss me off cause i not only get mad i get even too  mr 
get mad about what thats childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad i dont stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day i ask do u think the police was right for asking me  in my yard im  i know right from wrong also guy 
i am a little confused which is not hard to do 
i think you are asking me if it was okay that the cops who had stopped outside of your yard ask you over and question you about some white guy who was in your yard visiting with you  correct  
if that is right  then my answer is no  hell no  unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long  and even then there are ways and means for the cops to go about there business to conduct there investigations with out asking people about theres thats why the detectives make the big bucks to covertly investigate with out shooting off the alarm bells  
for some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property and start pumping you for information with out any justifiable cause is against your constatutional rights illegal immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge  
i know its done all the time and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it 
but my point is simply to smile at him tell him to have a nice day and walk away you dont ow him a thing if he still wants to push it then tell him you dont have to talk to him unless your lawyer is present  that will usually set them running  
i see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble because they start flapping there gums thinking they are cool and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in 
cops know from training how to push our buttons and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results  mr 
yes he did i was asking u do u think he was in the right guy 
damn dude  i was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you  
it totally freaks me that it could and would but dosent really surprise me anymore that it does considering that many citys had stop  frisk on the books untill only recently  but supposedly it has been done away with according to the courts recent rulings fat chance of that really happening cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people for there fishing for a crime scene 
i am sorry that it has and wish i could do something to stop it  knowing that because of the color of my skin is probably the only reason why it doesnt or hasnt to me  except when i was a kid living in berkeley ca then i got hassled by the cops quite a bit because of the hair down to my butt they all thought i was a drugged out hippy which a lot of the time was true i got slammed around by them quite a bit shot at and gassed a few times then arrested and served time in jail and probation for things that now are not considered a crime anymore  for some of the crap i use to do and the people i ran with i am lucky to be still breathing 
unfortunately that is the times we all live in and certainly it is unfair to you to be victimised because of it i hope you filed a complant against this ass hole to seek retrabutin  mr 
i understand that ive did things in my life im not happy bout cant sleep at nite the nightmare i have i jus take it one day at a time and think god im still breathing truth be told i almost lost my life  times before i was  and the only thing slowed me down from the streets is my first son hes  now my middle son  and my baby boy is  and i have a lil girl that jus turned  so i thank god a lot cause i have something to live for havent been to a club in yrs it feels good to be out the streets and doing some good for a change only thing i have did to make my life complete is going back to church but ill go when im ready but i do read the bible so there for i dont forget where i come from i respect u and dont know u its actually good we had this chat everything u told me i took that inconsideration truly i thank u i dont know everything but i dont mind listen mr 
i stop dealing drugs a few yrs ago actually until i find a job that pays  a hr when my ma first found out she had cancer i use to make sure i would not go home unless i had  a week in my pocket to help my ma with her medical bills and medicine she fought that cancer for yrs right before she died  yrs ago i promise her i wouldnt sale anymore and that was a promise i keep  at the end of the month i had to put in a lot of blood and tears for what i did and my ma was not proud of the blood money i was bringing into the home but when she seen what i was actually doing with my money i think she respect me to a certain degree and i accepted that sometimes she would accept nothing from me ive been locked up  times and started dealing weedcokegunspills at the age of  honestly my ma use to beat me when she found out but i never stopped i caught my first charge at  by the time i was  i had did everything i could possibly do i think i had a good run in life i never had my father after the fact he was a big time drug dealer and him and ma got a divorce and he got on his on product and lost everything he been sober for  yrs he doing good but i never hated him for what he did in life actually it made me stronger i had a step dad but only he was good for is taking me fishing far talking to bout men things he did cause he didnt know how to cause he had  girls but at the end of the day he raised me from the time i was  until he passed he was good man in his own ways and till this day i thank god for each parent i had in my life with no regrets i jus wish the world become a better place guy 
hey  at least you are still alive and hopefully clean and sober with a family that loves you  that is a lot more than some of the people you knew when you were running the streets ill bet consider yourself mr to be blessed  
never a father figure in my life just a strong willed old fashioned no nonsense mom who drove her father into oakland from brentwood everyday at the age of  in  she introduced me to the ymca in oakland when i was  took a lot of backpacking trips with them to the bottom of the grand canyon to visit the havasupai indians that lived there hiked all over california montana yellowstone yosemite and europe backpacking and hiking should be a mandatory class in hs especially to intercity kids who never get out and see the real world except concrete pavement and maybe a city park  
i understand why you did what you did you will receive no condemnation from me for it  some of the people i ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of wondering if they were at all human or not  hells angels and there buds were some i knew and partied with in the late s while living on telegraph ave in berkeley even ran into some original black panthers along the way now thouse guys were freaky and strange always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up  
what saved me was getting the hell out of there moving to a small town in the mountains finishing my college education there later meeting a good woman who put up with my bs and marrying her we have been together  years produced two fine sons that are a joy to us i became a small business man as owner operator of a landscape contracting company for  years first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience never went into farming with the family my brother was the one who did that with my mom my sister has her life with her husband  years but to say i was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way is close to the truth sometimes i rather talk to plants than people because its easer that way and they dont give me grief like people do 
hey  if you want to shoot me an email sometime i am not against it i can be reached at email protected after all this is a open and public forum and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result suit yourself mr 
im still alive cause god showed me awaywhere i didnt have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize i was only making memories in the streetsbut ill never think ill live to tell a lot of people who didnt know me my life style jus feel like before some of the whites judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasnt by choice thats for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also guy 
good to hear now what are you doing  mr 
doing father dutys guy 
so what s that for you  what line of work are you in how many rug rats you got running around your wife work or is she a stay at home mom  whats the town or city like you live in  got any hobbies or are you sports nuts 
just curious is all sure its none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken if you dont want to talk guy 
i hope your education dose not reflect the way you write but if it dose god help us all because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left to you so you can build onto it for the betterment of the future generations  your children and there childrens children  to come  mr 
as long as i graduated from high school im happy long as my job allow me to bring him  to  every two weeks im happy my education aint got nothing to with how i shorten my word like everyone else in life i be willing to bet i go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didnt know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight a students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions dont have nothing do with how i write im not in school anymore i feel i shouldnt have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids guy 
of course you are a proud father and well you should be dont we all as parents want and expect our children to be better than we were  i think that is only natural 
my sons both graduated from collage and are set in there lives both in there early s one married and living in alaska working as a city planner and the other is still here at home finishing up his education cheaper that way 
there mother and i dint get past a two year community collage degree with me going into business as a landscape contractor  years 
you are right your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring you dont have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that yours alone and who the hell am i to criticise  
mr you talk the way you want and feel comfortable in and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile if its okay with you mr 
i like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some american u only have wisdom from being wise hugh culliton 
call me premillennial but i find it baffling that anyone regardless of where they think itll go would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions is a terribly stupid thing to do 
in addition to unprofessional conduct she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy guy 
i dont agree at all  or perhaps it comes from your firm belief that you have never done something dumb rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive by someone else  hmmm  hugh culliton 
on the contrary  its precisely because i know that ive done and said dumb things and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked that i find it baffling that one would want such personal  and completely normal  incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded online 
we live in the world of total online or even onnetworkedcomputer collection of data as a high school teacher i deal with this every time i teach teens internet safety thats why i see it as being a generational trend by people whove grown up with their entire lives on line such an environment means that while on the upside we can out trolls racist leos and nasty pedophiles it also means that everyone need to be very very careful with all data and information they store online 
however in this case we have someone  not acting as a private citizen  but as a uniformed representative of the state  in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public taking personal images of a highly offensive nature mistake or not  its out there and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer guy 
she and everyone else who speaks in public  
trump has been made keenly aware of that fact as the results of what he said  yrs ago is now coming back to bite him as well clinton  
thanks for taking the time to further explain your point and now that you have i tend to agree with you although i still believe that the treatment to this young and naive lady was harsh  
but considering she works in a public tax supported office its to be expected to bad she dint have the common sense to see it  hill billy"

grab a box of tissues because this story is about to make you feel some bigtime feels 
two years ago john fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep john instantly thought of roberts yearold daughter sophie who was just starting to forge her path in life thats when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way with robert no longer there for her john took it upon himself to discourage his nieces art career 
okay is someone cutting onions in here because were getting just a little bit teary 
ever since his brothers passing john has made it a point to call his niece every single sunday evening to remind sophie just how much her father loved her how proud hed be if he could see her now and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional ninetofive employment sophies true passion in life has always been drawing and painting but thanks to her selfless uncles constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job shes now just two years away from getting her ba in marketing 
i want sophie to know that she can always depend on me john explained gazing tearfully at an old photograph of robert holding his baby girl but she cannot depend on freelance income especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts shes way too smart for that 
john has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist last summer when sophie landed an internship at a brooklyn art gallery john spent countless hours reminding her that new york is expensive dangerous and very far away from ohio before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead and when sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art her uncle pulled out all the stops even going so far as to gain control of her late fathers finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semesters tuition check until she changed her mind 
incredible is there an uncle of the year award because this guy definitely just won it 
while nobody can ever take the place of sophies father it is seriously heartwarming to see john step up to the plate like this sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love guidance and stacks of brochures for mba programs handed to her at every family holiday heres to you john"
111," things you need to know about trump and sex slave island by amanda prestigiacomo may   
presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at hillary clinton when it comes to her husbands escapades the kitchen sink in this case is jeffery epsteins sex slave island and president bill clintons ties to it  
why wouldnt trump use this ammo the answer is simple trump himself has ties to epstein the billionaire democratic donor and convicted pedophile known for having underage sex slaves on his private plane and what the media calls sex slave island 
here are seven connections between trump and epsteins sex slave endeavors that you need to know about 
 trump himself has said that epstein is a lot of fun to be with adding that he admired the sex offenders affinity for beautiful women on the younger side 
ive known jeff for fifteen years terrific guy trump once said about the convicted sex offender hes a lot of fun to be with it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as i do and many of them are on the younger side no doubt about it  jeffrey enjoys his social life 
 trump was named in epsteins little black book 
epsteins  little black book  was stolen by a former employee in  the book nicknamed the holy grail by the employee revealed the name of donald trump and listed  phone numbers including emergency numbers car numbers and numbers to trumps security guard and houseman 
 trump has allegedly flown on epsteins private plane  a hot spot for underage sex orgies 
mark epstein jeffreys brother testified in  that trump flew on jeffreys private jet at least once reports vice news  meanwhile message pads see below from epsteins palm beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by vice news indicate that trump called epstein twice in november of  
epsteins private boeing  according to one of his alleged victims virginia roberts was nicknamed the lolita express roberts recalled unsavoury sex orgies on the private plane when she was just  years of age with epstein and his friends 
 both trump and epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an underaged girl 
radar online reports that a woman in california identified as katie johnson filed a  million lawsuit against trump on april  accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just  years old 
johnson claims trump raped her when she was yearsold and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family notes the independent uk  she claims the alleged abuse took place over a fourmonth period at underage sex parties held in new york city in  epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats 
trumps team adamantly denies the accusation suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly no evidence the plaintiff actually exists 
 epstein admitted to knowing trump under oath and curiously pled the fifth to trump attending sex parties with underage girls 
back in  epstein admitted to socializing with trump but when a lawyer representing an underaged victim of epsteins asked if he has ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  epstein curiously pled the fifth per vice news  q have you ever had a personal relationship with donald trump a what do you mean by personal relationship sir q have you socialized with him a yes sir q yes a yes sir q have you ever socialized with donald trump in the presence of females under the age of  a though id like to answer that question at least today im going to have to assert my fifth sixth and th amendment rights sir 
 at least one of epsteins underage sex victims was recruited from trumps maralago  which he frequented often 
virginia roberts an alleged victim of epsteins was recruited to perform a massage for epstein while working as a perhour locker room attendant at maralago 
roberts claims that epstein turned her into a sex slave and pimped her out to various friends including englands prince andrew over the years the passengers on epsteins jet she said included a whole bunch of other girls sometimes famous people sometimes some politicians 
 trump was subpoenaed in  for his connection to epsteins underage sex slave rings trump has denied ever being served 
in  trump was subpoenaed in a case against epstein concerning victim virginia roberts trumps attorney alan garten said that the subpoena never happened 
there is no debate over what happened said one of roberts attorneys i served mr trump with a subpoena for deposition in  he talked to me voluntarily and consequently we withdrew the subpoena in light of his voluntarily providing information i cant imagine there being any dispute of any of this 
additionally garten told vice news in january that mr trump has no relationship with epstein other than the democratic donor frequenting trumps maralago a lot of people hung out there including jeffrey epstein said garten that is the only connection 
according to the evidence however the connections with epstein appear to go a lot deeper than that tags"
112,"go to article 
nothing ought to be plainer and yet nothing is more obscured than the meaning of the islamic concept of jihad even if its meaning were at all unclear every day islamic jihadists do their best to remind us of what it is the confusion arises of course from the fact that jihad and related concepts are the object of a massive misinformation and disinformation campaign making books such as william kilpatricks the politically incorrect guide to jihad so vitally necessary 
kilpatrick covers that propaganda campaign ably in this lucid and genial book which not only explains from islamic texts and teachings why isis and boko haram and other jihad terror groups are not only not unislamic as is frequently claimed but quintessentially islamic  for the quran as kilpatrick explains commands jihad and muhammad who is considered in islamic theology to the perfect man to be imitated by muslims whenever wherever and however possible not only commanded jihad warfare but waged it himself 
kilpatrick also helpfully takes up common objections to this line of argumentation  notably the question of why if islam really teaches warfare against unbelievers and their subjugation under the hegemony of islamic law most muslims are peaceful peaceful islam kilpatrick points out which western leaders are counting on to win out over the more violent versions touted by the terrorists is a holdover from the longdead colonial era indeed so the formulation of jihad as primarily an interior spiritual struggle was touted by islamic scholars at the height of the colonial period so as to allow for accommodation of the colonial occupiers who werent going away in the foreseeable future once they did abscond however the conditions that called forth such accommodative teachings no longer existed and saudifunded jihad preachers traversed the globe calling muslims back to jihad the forgotten obligation of warfare against unbelievers 
the politically incorrect guide to jihad shows that this transition had nothing to do with poverty among muslims or discrimination against them and indeed that no conciliation or concession on the part of western nonmuslims will ever blunt the force of the jihad imperative since it is rooted in islamic theological principles that are not susceptible to the prevailing political winds 
the most valuable sections however of this useful and engaging book are the second jihad without bombs and the third defeating jihad for even as violent jihad becomes an increasingly common feature of the western landscape more insidious and damaging in the long run may be the stealth jihad that proceeds due to the appeasement policies that western governments indefatigably pursue and the politically correct straitjacket on the public discourse that has for well over a decade now hindered and usually prevented outright honest discussion in the mainstream media of the nature and magnitude of this threat kilpatrick points out that according to reporters without borders the us has dropped to fortysixth place in press freedom one of the principal ways in which the press today reveals itself to be a mouthpiece of moneyed elites is in its deliberate attempts to obfuscate the ideological roots of the jihad threat and its ongoing campaign every time there is a jihad attack to inundate us with articles explaining that islam is really quite wonderful and has nothing to do with this violence nothing at all 
but kilpatrick details how the media and governing elites are not in the least singular in appearing determined to foster complacency and ignorance among the people they should be enlightening and protecting the churches are in on the act as well christians writes kilpatrick have been lulled into complacency by the oftrepeated emphasis on the similarities between their faith and the faith of muslims  an emphasis all too many church leaders including of course pope francis relentlessly hammer home heedless of the danger in which they are putting their flock by leaving them intellectually spiritually and physically defenseless in the face of an advancing and growing threat 
thats why the most apposite sentence in this entire book is the second sentence of the chapter headed strategies for victory first weve got to get serious the west suffers from a collective lack of seriousness that could in the end be fatal the frivolity is at the top fueled by globalist internationalists who are using the complacency the media the government and the church are fostering for their own ends the politically incorrect guide to jihad is the perfect book for those who dont know just how bad things are and how likely they are to get even worse  as well as for all who wish to chart a way out of this madness it can be done william kilpatrick does it quite well in this book"

san francisco california  the adobo chronicles san francisco bureau  now it can be told  now that hillary clinton is all but assured of the democratic presidential nomination 
for months since the former secretary of state launched her presidential bid her campaign logo has always symbolized americas quest to move forward with the arrow in the logo pointing to the right lefthanded people of course dispute that symbolism because for them moving forward should be pointing to the left 
but there is another school of thought about hillarys logo many believe that the arrow pointing right actually symbolizes moving to the conservative right as opposed to the liberal left 
the logo was a brilliant concept designed to help the democrats win over republican voters in the general elections  voters who will definitely choose a rightist over a leftist candidate 
the gops presumptive nominee donald trump is perceived by many as more leftist than rightist which would give clinton the edge among conservative voters 
who knew the placement or direction of an arrow could spell victory or defeat for an american presidential candidate rate this"

your vote is statistically meaningless and will not sway the selection your vote is strategically meaningless and decides nothing about the future of the country your vote is useless as the selection is rigged anyway but as larken rose of larkenrosecom reminds us what really matters is that voting is immoral legitimizing a system of authoritarian control and empowering the oligarchs who created the system and control its results

trump being trump he stepped on stage and immediately wrecked any chance republicans had of taking advantage of the email story 
trump went into full hyperbolic overdrive in new hampshire by claiming that the fbis reopening of the investigation was bigger than watergate 
the republican nominee took back his claim that the system is rigged 
video following fbi announcement into clintons emails trump remarks the system might not be as rigged as i thought httpstcokiuxbvef 
 abc news politics abcpolitics october   
trump said but with what ive just announced previously it might not be as rigged as i thought right the fbi i think theyre going to right the ship folks i think theyre going to right the ship and theyre going to save their great reputation by doing so the speculation is that the fbi is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that hillary clinton did nothing wrong 
trump and the republicans are jumping to some conclusions they know that clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs they are assuming that the fbi is going to find evidence that hillary clinton did something wrong and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting trump elected 
trump has no political skills and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop the republican nominee destroyed any hope that the gop had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold 
the email scandal isnt going to help republicans it hasnt before and it wont now but trumps over the top incompetence has killed any boost that republicans might have gotten from the story"
117,i liked megan kelly past tense how much did the clintons pay her more importantly newt gingrich was  accurate with his comment about megan and her word choice ask yourself why could she not bring herself to use predator and bill clinton in the same sentence if these allegations are true why wouldnt these women have filed lawsuits against a billionair seeking monetary compensation at the time of the sexual assaults i would like to point out that every charge of sexual improprietys against trump  twenty prior to this last gaggle of liars  have been dismissed or have had not guilty verdictseach and every one and its important to note none has had a monetary settlement why are these women only coming out with their stories   years after their bogus claims each of these women should be found guilty of interfering with a presidential election making false charges and damaging the believability of sexual assault charges by any woman in the future these women need to be spending some time in prison should the democratic party be linked to these womens allegations especially should there have been money exchanged either hillary or bill or both need to be behind bars as well

according to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years among the many alleged secrets the vatican has there is a device called the chronovisor the device enables its user to observe future as well as past events many believe this device is one of the greatest guarded secrets humanity has ever had 
some even believe it is a crucial tool which has allowed the vatican to preserve its influence and power through the years 
ever since h g wells composed his novel the time machine many people have been left fascinated by the idea of time travel even theoretical physics dreams of the possibility of making it work one day everything related to time travel today is related to science fiction or so it seems at least interestingly on may   an italian newspaper shocked the world when they published an article with a provoking headline a machine that photographs the past has finally been invented  
the news article indicated that dozens of scientists created an artifact that allowed them to photograph the past and even witness important historical accounts directly connected with jesus christ 
the alleged device which according to many is nothing more than science fiction was built in the s by a team of scientists led by father pellegrino maria ernetti an italian physicist who eventually became a priest 
it is believed that the team received important help from nobel laureate enrico fermi and famous rocket scientist wernher von braun 
the chronovisor is a relatively small object that is equipped with a number of antennas and is composed entirely of precious alloys cathode tubes some dials and levers reports by father ernetti suggest that whoever uses the device is able to capture and record specific locations important events and follow in history noteworthy individuals according to father ernetti he had observed among other historical events christs crucifixion and photographed it as well view image the image to the left is the one obtained using the chronovisor on the right is a similar image located in a church in perugia 
it is even said that under the perfect conditions the device offers its user the ability to foresee what was going to happen in the near future 
however father ernetti remained secretive and stated he was not at liberty to reveal further details about the chronovisor 
father ernetti did however reveal that the chronovisor worked by processing residual electromagnetic radiation left over by numerous processes 
according to numerous reports father ernetti used the chronovisor to witness important historical events with the most notable being the crucifixion of christ 
however father ernetti revealed that thanks to this invention had managed to witness the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and other major historical events such as the founding of rome in  bc also thanks to the chronovisor father ernetti was able to recompose the missing work thyestes  written by ennio quinto and represented in rome in  ac in its original version and the original text of the the two stone tablets written by god exodus  which were given to moses on mount sinai apart from witnessing the likes of napoleon roman philosopher cicero and other great and momentous historical and biblical episodes 
french priest françois charles antoine brune was one of the first to hear about the chronovisor according to father françois he met father ernetti in the s when the two were traveling across the grand canal of venice as the two were experts in ancient languages they began to talk about the bible and its interpretation through the years supposedly these are the blueprints of the chronoviso r image 
father brune that was very intrigued when the father ernetti revealed that there was a machine that could answer all questions related to the bible 
when father françois asked about the machine father ernetti described the chronovisor saying that it was device that functioned just like a tv but instead of receiving transmissions from local stations the chronovisor was able to tune into the past and allow the viewer to see and hear events that had occurred centuries before 
ernetti told brune that the machine worked by detecting images and sounds that humanity had created which were floating in space 
it is said that this intriguing device and the project behind it were canceled by the vatican but not destroyed some believe the chronovisor is located somewhere in the vatican hidden in one of the many chambers hidden away from society 
however there are other versions that suggest that father ernetti and his team decided to voluntarily dismantle the device because since it could tune anywhere and anytime in the past if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could create the scariest dictatorship the world has ever seen 
interestingly before father ernetti died in april  he wrote a letter in which he insisted that the device was real and was not a hoax as many believed 
father ernetti claimed that the alleged photograph the chronovisor had captured of jesus christ on the cross showing the sorrowful face of a bearded man gazing towards the heavens was real even though some critics argue that the image was a reproduction of a statue of jesus located in a church in perugia 
critics also claim that the alleged text the device managed to observe of thyestes included latin words that did not exist at the time it was made 
in  father ernetti also said that pope pius xii forbade us to do disclose any details about this device because the machine was very dangerous it can restrain the freedom of man 
however in  the vatican issued a decree in which it warned that anyone using an instrument of such characteristics would be excommunicated according to many this was an unnecessary warning since according to them the chronovisor never existed so why issue a warning if it was just another hoax 
what do you think about the story behind the chronovisor do you think it is another top secret object kept away from society by the vatican sf source rise earth"

leading republican presidential hopeful suggests israelipalestinian peace accord may be impossible sometimes agreements cant be madeafter being asked by a voter at a charleston south carolina town hall event hosted by msnbc about what steps he would take to broker an accommodation between the sides in the conflict the gop contender vowed to give it one hell of a shot and called it probably the toughest agreement of any kind to makebut when pressed by host joe scarborough over whether he ascribed fault to either israelis or palestinians over the failure to reach a lasting accord trump declined to take sides 
you know i dont want to get into it because  if i win i dont want to be in a position where im saying to you and the other side now says we dont want trump involved trump said 
let me be sort of a neutral guy he continued a lot of people have gone down in flames trying to make that deal so i dont want to say whose fault is it i dont think it helpstrump also expressed skepticism over the possibility of achieving a twostate solution given the conditions of the conflict and the need for any agreement to be sustainable over time 
its possible its not makeable because dont forget it has to last  its wonderful to make it and it doesnt work but it has to last he said to make lasting peace there probably the toughest deal of all but im going to give it a shot 
though he was not asked directly what he considers the most substantial obstacles standing in the way of a peace agreement he suggested that growing hostility between the two peoples was contributing to the current stalemate and what he considers the root of the conflict 
a lot of people say an agreement cant be made which is okay i mean sometimes agreements cant be made not good but you know you have both sides really but one side in particular growing up and learning that these are the worst people he said i was with a very prominent israeli the other day he says its impossible because the other side has been trained from the time theyre children to hate jewish peoplein the past trump has questioned israels commitment to peace while at the same time suggesting the jewish state does not have a negotiating partner in the palestinians he has also called prime minister benjamin netanyahu a good friend 
at a presidential candidates forum hosted by the republican jewish coalition in december  the real estate magnate said i dont know that israel has the commitment to make it and i dont know that the other side has the commitment to make it 
he made the same point in an interview with ap earlier that day a lot will have to do with israel and whether or not israel wants to make the deal  whether or not israels willing to sacrifice certain things he said they may not be and i understand that and im okay with that but then youre just not going to have a deal

123,"by jon rappoport 
i begin this piece with three quotes from my workinprogress the underground 
there is a media metaphysics its basic principle states that nothing exists until it becomes information now we have a new twist information only becomes real when it reaches a mind already attuned to it in other words the tree falling in the forest makes a sound only if a userconsumer who wants a tree to fall receives video and audio of the event 
information can be dressed up a thousand different ways but it tends to have an elastic quality by that i mean you eventually get to see the person who dressed it up thats a problem for chronic liars who inhabit the press they expose themselves even though they dont want to it takes a surprisingly small push to expose the whole operation this is happening now right in front of our eyes 
the basis of big media is theater news is theater its directors and producers think theyre doing a firstrate job but theyre sadly mistaken gaps and obfuscations are growing larger the outright nonsequiturs and gibberish are becoming more apparent the audience is wising up to the farce who are these fools who direct the news theyre simply people who want to sell their souls and have found an elite buyer but that transaction doesnt contain any guarantees about shelf life mainstream news is decaying and the expiration date is approaching like civilizations the petty princes of information rise and fall 
globalized media its nice plan lets examine it 
the new technocratic media is based on profiling users there is no impactful news unless each member of the audience is surveilled and analyzed on the basis of what he already likes and wants 
shocking its to be expected how else would technocrats parlay the untold hours theyve spent sizing up their consumersusers 
several years ago i wrote tech blather has already begun since jeff bezos ceo of amazon bought the washington post at a fire sale jeff genius will invent new ways to transmit the news to people on the go and make the post a smashing success mobile devices multiple platforms digital taking over from print ads customized to fit readers interests profiling news stories customized to fit readers interests more profiling 
in other words nonnews if you thought media were irrelevant and deceptive before you havent seen anything the new news will create millions of virtual bubbles in which profiled users can float contentedly under the cozy cottage roofs of their favorite little separate paradigms 
the tech giant apple has waded into this territory with an app that will deliver news to users yahoo apple news part of the upcoming ios  operating system aims to be the primary news source for users of the iphone and ipad apple says its news app follows over a million topics and pulls relevant stories based on your specific interests joshua benton of the nieman journalism lab said the app will be important because through the awesome power of default apple distribution puts it in an entirely other league this news app will be on hundreds of millions of devices within  hours of its debut 
translation profiling their users down to their toenails apple will present them with virtual bubbles of news they want to see and read 
not just one overall presentation for all no different news outlets for apples audiences 
this introduces a whole new layer of mind control 
youre an obama fan here are stories confirming your belief in the prophet 
you want neocon on the rocks with a conservative republican twist heres some war footage thatll warm your heart 
do you believe government gridlock is our biggest concern congress cant get anything done weve got headlines for that from here to the moon 
tuned into celeb gossip heres your world in three minutes 
the idea convince users one day at a time that what they already believe is important is the news of the day 
its decentralized centralization one media giant carving its global audience up into little pieces and delivering them a whole host of different algorithmically appropriate lies and fluff and nocontext psyops 
and for fringe users youre doubtful about gmos well look at what whole foods is planning for their healthier produce section cheer up nothing about maui voters declaring a temporary ban on devastatingly toxic monsantodow experiments or the dangers of roundup youre antivaccine sorry you dont count youre not a recognized demographic but heres a piece about a little unvaccinated boy who was involved in car crash on the i 
does this sound like science fiction it isnt its the mainstream look of the nearfuture search engines are already personalizing your inquiries us abc national news is climbing in the ratings because its giving viewers lighter stories and spending less time on thorny issues like the middle east 
the mainstream news business is desperately looking for audience and treating every user as a profiled socialconstructbundle of superficial preferences is their answer 
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth 
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands 
the onetwo punch 
any actual event occurring in the world will be predigested by robot media editors and profilers and then split up into variously programmed bits of information for different audiences 
who cares what really happened in the new world there is no what really happened thats a gross misnomer a faulty idea a metaphysical error no there is only a multiforked media tongue that simultaneously spits out a dozen or a hundred variations of the same eventbecause different viewers want and expect different realities 
in   orwells big brother was issuing a single voice into the homes of the population that was oldschool that was primitive technology that was achieving unity by hammering unity into peoples skulls this now is the frontier of unity through diversity 
we want to make all of you into androids through basic pr and propaganda and a pathetic excuse for education however we recognize youll become different varieties of androids and well serve that outcome with technological sophistication trust us we care about what you prefer 
user a wow did you see the coverage of the border war in chula vista 
user b war they had a fantastic exhibit of drones down there at least a hundred different types and then i watched an old ww movie about aerial combat 
user c chula vista they had a great food show this woman made a lemon pie i could practically taste it 
user d that wasnt a border war it was a drill and then afterwards these cops gave a demonstration of all their gear vests shields communication devices flashbangs auto rifles with silencers batons i watch drills all over the country love them 
user e chula vista the only thing i saw on the news was sunny and mild this week i watch all the weather channels i love them 
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone 
one problem though major media have been lanced thousands of times by alt news sites and by wikileaks and project veritas this attack has exposed the truth and the clinton crimes 
and alt news reflects the growing interest of the public in whats actually happening on many fronts 
the technocratic plan for the news is failing 
it was a nice plan but 
its turning out to be a dud 
alt media are forcing public awareness of one giant scandal after another hillaryobama support for isis provaccine liars the collapse of obamacare the gmo hustle pesticide damageon and on and on 
the result major media are being backed into a corner where they must defend lies and build monolithic lies for everyone all the time the idea of creating separate news for each profiled user is collapsing 
major media are playing defense against the rest of the world 
its quite a party 
and it has no expiration date 
a final note trump wikileaks project veritas drudge and many alt news sites created a perfect storm in  raining down on major media it was and is unprecedented the mainstream press has been exposed down to its roots as never before the lying the collusion the arrogant sense of entitlement the desperation the corruptionits all there to see for anyone who has eyes and a few working brain cells expect more to come regardless of the outcome of the election the train has really left the station

126,"the psychopathic and insincere jihad islams natural appeal to criminals psychopaths and murderers october   
raymond ibrahim is a shillman fellow at the david horowitz freedom center 
whenever muslims engage in behavior that ostensibly contradicts islamfrom taking drugs and watching porn to killing fellow muslims islams apologists loudly proclaim aha see theyre not true muslims or in the words of cia head john brennan on the islamic state they are terrorists theyre criminals mostmanyof them are psychopathic thugs murderers who use a religious concept and masquerade and mask themselves in that religious construct 
overlooked is that many selfstyled jihadis are indeed psychopathic thugs murderers some may not even believe in allah at all yet this does not exonerate islam for its religious construct was designed to entice such men 
as usual  this traces back to the prophet muhammad after telling his followers that allah had permitted muslims four wives and limitless concubines koran  he later claimed that allah had delivered a new revelation koran  permitting him muhammad alone to marry and sleep with as many women as he wanted in response his young wife aisha quipped i feel that your lord hastens in fulfilling your wishes and desires apostates from islam regularly cite this episode as especially disenchanting them with the prophet 
but it is the concept of jihad that especially comports with those who seek to indulge their carnal appetites for whoever fights in the name of allah andor seeks to empower islamthat is jihadisterroristsis exonerated of all blame and if he dies fighting guaranteed the highest levels of paradise where more sex awaits 
thats because allah made a pact with them according to koran  allah has bought from the believers their lives and worldly goods and in return has promised them paradise they shall fight in the way of allah and shall slay and be slain rejoice then in the bargain you have struck for that is the supreme triumph muhammad elaborated lining up for battle in the path of allah jihad to empower islam is worthier than  years of worship moreover the martyr is special to allah he is forgiven from the first drop of blood that he sheds he sees his throne in paradise he will wed the aynhour supernatural celestial women designed exclusively for sexual purposes and will not know the torments of the grave and safeguards against the greater horror hell fixed atop his head will be a crown of honor a ruby that is greater than the world and all it contains and he will copulate with seventytwo aynhour 
as for those muslims who reject jihad muhammad said they will be tortured like no other sinful human for many more islamic scriptures depicting jihad as the greatest undertaking one that earns unconditional forgiveness and paradise see here  
there is no denying that the historic growth of islam is related to its carnal incentives after more than a decade of preaching in mecca muhammad had about  followers mostly relatives it was only when he became a successful warlord and caravan raider that his followers grew and multiplied so long as such fighters helped spread the banner of islam into infidel lands they were deemed good and pious muslimsregardless of their true intentions priorities or even faith 
many of the original jihadis now revered in islamic hagiography were by modern standards little more than mass killing psychotics consider khalid bin alwalid a meccan pagan he opposed muhammad for years but when the prophet seized mecca khalidlike many of muhammads foes such as his archenemy abu sufyanexpediently converted proclaimed the shahada  joined the winning team and then went ajihadingmutilating plundering raping enslaving crucifying and setting people on fire in the process but because he did so under the banner of jihad this serial killer and rapist is today one of islams most revered heroes 
the reason for this is that nowhere in islam is there talk about the condition of the jihadis heart or if hes right with god allah is not god he is not interested in hearts and minds but in fighters and swords so long as his fighters proclaim the shahada there is no god but allah and muhammad is his messengerand fight under the banner of islam they can take plunder murder and rape the infidels and if they die doing so they go to paradise 
such was the genius of muhammad in the arabian society he lived in members of ones tribe were as inviolable as nonmembers were free game to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity muhammad took this idea and infused it with a pious rationale henceforth there would be only two tribes in the world the umma which consists of all muslims regardless of raceand the infidels who deserve to be plundered enslaved or killed with impunity for rejecting allah 
this explains why other tribalnomadic societiesturks and mongolstatars whose way of life consisted of preying on everyone outside their tribealso converted to islam and under the banner of jihad continued preying on the other the infidel but now as venerated champions of the faith 
christian europe was aware of islams true appeal from the very beginning theophanes the byzantine scholar d  wrote the following about muhammad in his chronicles he taught those who gave ear to him that the one slaying the enemyor being slain by the enemyentered into paradise see koran  and he said paradise was carnal and sensualorgies of eating drinking and women also there was a river of wine  and the women were of another sort and the duration of sex greatly prolonged and its pleasure longenduring eg koran     and all sorts of other nonsense 
centuries later st thomas aquinas d  made similar observations he muhamad seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh urges us his teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure in all this as is not unexpected he was obeyed by carnal men as for proofs of the truth of his doctrine muhammad said that he was sent in the power of his armswhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants what is more no wise men men trained in things divine and human believed in him from the beginning those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers utterly ignorant of all divine teaching through whose numbers mohammed forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms 
there is finally another group of muslims who should not be overlooked these do not give a fig for allah nor wish to be martyred in exchange for paradise but they rely on islam to justify robbing enslaving raping and killing nonmuslims as many christian minorities in nations like pakistan and egypt will attest because their victims are just infidelsand its a sin to aid a nonmuslim against a muslim that is a nontribal member against a tribal membermuslim criminals target nonmuslim minorities precisely because they know muslim authorities will not do a thing on behalf of the victimized infidels 
in short enough of these claims that this or that jihadi is in the words of the cias brennan terrorists criminals psychopathic thugs and murderers yes they are but that doesnt change the fact that one group of them is convinced that no matter how immoral or perverse their behavior is as long as they continue fighting and dying in the name of jihad paradise is assured them and another group doesnt care a bit about the afterlife but knows that as long as they only victimize infidels no muslim will hold them accountable in both cases islam aids and abets their behavior"

128,"interviews the fbi probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar says american analyst scott bennett 
the ongoing federal investigation into the clinton foundation was expected because of the clinton familys ties with us enemies says scott bennett a former us army psychological warfare officer 
the fbi has been probing possible paytoplay schemes at the family foundation for over a year now and is likely to press charges against it fox news reported wednesday citing informed officials 
bennett told press tv on friday that the probe was inevitable because of the metastasizing of the links and the connections that the clinton foundation had most specifically and grievously to saudi arabia to qatar and many other countries blacklisted by washington 
it was revealed on friday that the clinton foundation took a  million gift from qatar during hillary clintons tenure as the us secretary of state without her informing the state department 
hillary decided to not inform the department of the transaction despite signing an ethics agreement with regards to the foundation when she became secretary of state 
according to the foundations website qatar has so far given the clintons a total of between  million and  million over the years 
aside from qatar saudi arabia has also been one of the clinton foundations biggest donors it became known in  that the kingdom had given them between  million and  million 
so those terrorist entities which have been labeled as the enemies of the united states have been appearing as clinton foundation donors bennett said 
that is a serious crime it is treason it is corruption it is bribery of officials said the analyst 
bennett argued that all the leaks and investigations concerning the clinton family were coming from those personnel in the american government who have had enough 
they have stepped up they have released emails they have hacked into their own computers and in some cases they have provided it to wikileaks he added 
whistleblowing website wikileaks has released thousands of hillarys campaign chairman and top aide john podestas emails since last month exposing some of the wellkept secrets surrounding the clinton family and hillary clintons bid for the white house 
bennett predicted that the case would most probably lead to indictments and some people would be arrested as early as this weekend loading"

contrary to some republican hopes donald trumps slide has not stopped trump continues to lose support with men in iowa and georgia north carolina appears to be slipping away from trump and the republican nominee has blown his leads in iowa and georgia 
the trump campaign has gone as far as to admit that if they lose florida they will lose the election but the signs are evident in the polling that the republican party is much closer to experiencing a landslide than they are to winning the white house in november 
a trump landslide defeat could trigger a disaster for republicans that leads to additional democratic senate pickups beyond the four seats needed to take back the majority republicans could see their current record house majority gutted in a clinton landslide 
the election is not getting better for republicans the landscape is getting worse if this polling continues for another week at the state level democrats could be looking at their best case scenario of a democratic white house house and senate being in play"

the number of wild animals on earth could fall by more than twothirds in the  years to  according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats hunting and pollution the forecast could lead to major consequences for humans 
the living planet report  says that animal losses are on track to reach  percent in the  years to  the reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline citing a  percent plummet between  and  
the researchers analyzed the changing presence of  monitored populations of the  vertebrate species  mammals birds fish amphibians and reptiles among them 
according to the paper the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem vaccineladen mms to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets httpstcowmduucnxn pictwittercomafxrag 
humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate said wwfs director of science mike barrett a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
animals across the planet are expected to be affected however rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures 
we are no longer a small world on a big planet we are now a big world on a small planet where we have reached a saturation point the stockholm resilience centers professor johan rockström said in a foreword for the report 
the decline in wildlife along with climate change is part of the proposed notion of anthropocene a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on earths geology and ecosystems 
the notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences 
the richness and diversity of life on earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems as we know them today will collapse wwf directorgeneral marco lambertini said as quoted by the guardian 
in fact the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition 
increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources the report states 
there does however appear to be some hope some species are beginning to recover suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis 
however barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place society must largely change how it consumes resources 
youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business barrett said 
the report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are he added my hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair we have to crack on and act i do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the anthropocene but the will has to be there to do it

post election the media and donald trump voters everywhere have been rewriting recent history they are making the claim that trump wasnt elected because of racism he was elected because of the economy the problem with that argument though is that its simply not true trump voters are racist and theres proof 
the american national elections study anes began the study in january initially they asked how likely is it that many whites are unable to find a job because employers are hiring minorities instead now of course anyone who spends more than five minutes listening to those in minority communities know the answer to that its very unlikely that whites arent getting jobs because minorities are but thats not what trump voters think the vast majority said that its extremely likely that minorities are taking jobs from white people graph courtesy of anes and salon  
then they asked the same trump voters about a nonracial issue trade despite the fact that trade was one of trumps signature issues their opinions on trade were mixed 
post election this is what the study found 
the question about white jobs is powerfully linked to support for trump over clinton eightyfour percent of whites who believe it is extremely likely that whites cant find a job because employers are hiring people of color instead support trump compared with  percent of those who think it is not at all likely among white democrats  percent who believe people of color are taking jobs support trump over clinton compared with less than  percent of those who believe it is not at all likely eightyone percent of white women who think it is extremely likely people of color are taking jobs supported trump compared with  percent who dont think that 
more than that  percent of white trump supporters say black people are violent  percent think that of muslims 
unfortunately democrats might not be able to just ride out this wave of racism hoping that eventually the aging bigots will die off it turns out their children are just as bad sean mcelwee the man who was responsible for publishing the study suggested this 
democrats must create a narrative that weaves economic racial and gender justice together a multiracial coalition is the path to sustained political power and reductions in economic racial and gender inequality as ive shown with political scientist jason mcdaniel racism often diminishes support for progressive policies the solution is not to abandon either the white working class or the diverse and rising american electorate that still stands poised to transform the nation 
great idea if we had a media that reported facts instead of letting bigots claims go unchallenged

citizens of the united states have chosen the wealthy businessman donald trump as their new president trump who was considered a wild card candidate will take control of the country in january to fill his four year term violent protests are raging and attacks against those who oppose trump or fail to fit his criteria of acceptability are on the rise trump supporters have also been attacked to say the very least this is the dawning of a new age in america to put it mildly trump alienated huge swaths of humanity during his campaign women mexicans muslims blacks the media have all taken their turns at his whipping pole trumps harsh words have been used to condemn huge groups the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
the only people trump hasnt attacked are white american males
interestingly trump shares many traits with the man who brought germany to its knees during wwii adolph hitler hitler rallied germans by directing national anger toward two primary groups the communists and the jews trump rallied americans by directing high doses of anger toward mexico and muslims trumps perception of mexican immigrants is way off the mark as the majority of those who emigrate to the us are hard working people willing to perform roles most white americans avoid like field harvesting nonetheless trump has described them as rapists and criminals tossing a blanket over every human being who finds their way to the us through illegal means
when it comes to muslims mr trump is exceptionally ignorant he fulfills the thoughts of those in the middle east who already believe the us has a long range plan to eliminate islam
millions of americans are having a meltdown over the election of trump while those who supported his bid for presidency continue to express anger and simultaneously imitate trumps bully demeanor by attacking those who disagree with their point of view particularly in social media insults have never been so foul and widespread everyone is riled people are unsure of what to do it seems almost certain that things are going to get a lot worse before they could ever get better
more defeating white liberalism in the age of trump brian cloughley the greatest achievement of mr trump would be engage in positive discussions with russia and china arise president trump or why its not the end of the world as we know it trumps sexual predator characteristics  his grandfather was a pimp but at least he paid the women he hired on a positive note trump has backed off on his threat to dismantle obamacare one thing is certain donald trump is extremely willing to toss out ideas and positions and then change his mind the following day unfortunately trump did this when initially exposing the connection between barack obama and hillary clinton and isis
it is an absolute fact that the united states was directly responsible for starting two more wars in the middle east in syria and libya both conflicts were deadly and destabilizing and waged at the request of israel as a wikileaks cable recently confirmed the mere idea that nations are trampled this way cements our understanding of how obama and clinton operate it also speaks volumes about the dark ways that the us has been manipulated by the zionist government of israel a nation that drains us taxpayers of more than  million a day the track record of human rights violations in israel goes well beyond unforgivable
the isis expose was a golden moment for trump even though he didnt stick to his guns the wars the us has been waging in recent years are all unjustified conflicts used to make large amounts of money for groups like halliburton and mercenary organizations while the us government spends trillions on killing it has historically ignored the suffering its allies direct toward their own citizens one great example is saudi arabia the radical wahhabi government that still beheads people in public in strict violation of international lawthese problems have sullied us support for many years
the only hope for the future lies in peace and reconciliation for clinton maintaining peace was a seemingly impossible task lest we forget it was her threats of war toward russia and iran that crossed the line for large numbers of americans parading as a liberal hillary clintons warmongering is legendary the democratic national committee debacle that derailed the only promising candidate bernie sanders was equally reprehensible
in the end there were no good choices for us voters the protrump crowd may not feel as victorious once they realize that mr trump does not care about them in any way shape or form only days after the election it is already being announced that the tax cuts trump promised will only be a fraction of what he claimed it is reminiscent of former us president george bushs famous words read my lips no new taxes of course each man offered the promise as an election gimmick each time it was enough to convince republicans trump is here to promote his own needs and to meet his own goals perhaps some of his political moves will coincide with the wishes of his voters perhaps not
in the meanwhile tempers are flaring and americans are increasingly turning against each other the real unavoidable truth is that donald trump will be the next us president he says he is going to make america great again and many of us wonder exactly what that means in the postwwii years there was peace unless you were black americans had freedom unless they were women or minorities
the united states has always waged illegal wars dating back to the very beginning when one treaty with native people after another was broken is donald trump going to keep the us out of wars for the next four years it would be a very good thing if he did
on one hand it seems entirely doubtful that the country will make it through four years of donald trump but giving up is not the answer if trump goes too far out of sync or becomes embroiled in charges that he cant pay off or threaten away there is an impeachment process that americans can follow"

have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

wikileaks has provided a treasure trove of inside information on what hillary clinton really thinks about important issues such as trade and immigration but clinton herself has chosen not to answer questions about the revelations 
she has focused instead on criticizing the russians as the source of the hacks despite the fact there is no proof of russian involvement 
the emails also shed light on how the clinton campaign interacts with wall street banks with friendly media and how it worked to undermine the candidacy of democratic rival bernie sanders with the help of the dnc 
wikileaks says it has about  emails from the private gmail account of john podesta a senior democratic party official who has served as white house chief of staff under president bill clinton and a senior adviser to president obama he was the author of obamas climate change policy john podesta 
in february podesta moved seamlessly from the white house to become chairman of hillary clintons  presidential campaign 
here are some of the most explosive revelations from the wikileaks email dumps featuring podestas account and others

149,"frank camp november   
during an interview with lesley stahl for  minutes  which will air in its entirety sunday night donald trump began to walk back his campaign promise regarding the deportation of illegal immigrants 
we are getting them out of our country the president elect said about the several million illegal immigrants with serious criminal records after the border is secure and after everything gets normalized were going to make a determination on the people youre talking about who are terrific people theyre terrific people who were going to make a determination on but before we make a determination we want to secure our border 
gasp 
donald trump rose to political fame on the back of his strong stance on illegal immigration throughout the primary process he promised a  deportation force  telling msnbcs mika brzezinski in november  
youre going to have a deportation force and youre going to do it humanely dont forget mika that you have millions of people that are waiting in line to come into this country and theyre waiting to come in legally and i always say the wall were going to build the wall its going to be a real deal its going to be a real wall 
in august trump delivered a major immigration speech in phoenix arizona in which he softened his stance a bit focusing on illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes 
within ice i am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in america who have evaded justice 
he then added that anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation that is what it means to have laws and to have a country otherwise we dont have a country 
during the final presidential debate between donald trump and hillary clinton trump reiterated his position against amnesty 
well first of all clinton wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years we need strong borders 
for trump diehards these statements were enough their guy was going to deport  million illegal immigrants and no one would tell them otherwise however as anyone with access to google should know the president elect has long supported amnesty in some fashion 
in july  donald trump told cnns dana bash 
i would get people out and then have an expedited way of getting them back into the country so they can be legala lot of these people are helping usand sometimes its jobs a citizen of the united states doesnt want to do i want to move em out and were going to move em back in and let them be legal 
what trump was talking about is known as touchback amnesty such a plan would indeed involve the deportation of illegal immigrants but allow them an expedited means of returning to the united states in order to obtain legal status in other words they touch base in their home country then come right back 
in november  eric trump repeated his fathers plan during an interview with fox news megyn kelly 
the point isnt just deporting them its deporting them and letting them back in legally hes been so clear about that and i know the liberal media wants to misconstrue it but its deporting them and letting them back legally 
going back further trumps support for amnesty is even more stark speaking on fox  friends in  he said 
for people that have been here for years that have been hardworkers have good jobs theyre supporting their familyits very very tough to just say by the way  years you have to leave get outim one of the worlds very conservative people but i have to tell you on a human basis how do you throw somebody out thats lived in this country for twenty years 
during the  presidential election cycle trump even called mitt romneys idea of selfdeportation  maniacal  and remarked that republican party policy toward illegal immigrants was  meanspirited  
donald trump is a man who will say whatever he needs to in order to win now that he has won hes already backtracking on multiple campaign promises from the repeal of the affordable care act aca to the deportation of illegal immigrants tags"

get ready for the most heartwarming story youll read all day 
if you met paul langdon or ayesha qamar on the street you might think they have nothing in common paul is a retired firefighter ayesha is a law student paul has lived in the same suburb of columbus for his entire life ayesha immigrated to ohio from pakistan when she was a teen paul is a devout christian ayesha is muslim but if you dig a little deeper youll find that they share a common bond both paul and ayesha have trump painted on their garages 
beautiful take a look at the sidebyside pictures above to see just how similar these two really are 
when donald trump announced his campaign last summer paul knew he wanted to show his support by painting a large sign of the candidates name on his garage door but paul probably never would have guessed that one year later just a few towns over from him ayeshas own garage would be painted with literally the exact same word paul and ayesha may be from totally different walks of life but when it comes to the name currently painted on their garages these two have more in common than they ever could have imagined 
at the end of the day it doesnt matter whether their skin is white or brown it doesnt matter whether they worship god or allah and it doesnt matter whether the word trump has been carefully lettered or hastily scrawled across the garage in brusque spray paint all that matters is the commonality they share in having the word trump painted on their homes for the entire neighborhood to see 
amazing it just goes to show you should never judge a book by its cover 
at a time when our country feels so divided stories like this one give us hope for humanity on the surface paul and ayesha couldnt be more different but the messages painted or spraypainted across their garages are one in the same what an amazing reminder that were not so different after all"

 bryan anderson bryanranderson october   
trumps insulting and racially tinged rhetoric came hours after he was in charlotte reaching out to the africanamerican community and promising a new deal for black america if elected president 
the republican nominee has insulted africanamerican voters throughout much of the campaign often calling their communities hell and claiming they only live in areas riddled with crime and crumbling schools 
of course in true trump form he didnt just use tasteless rhetoric insulting to the africanamerican community at his rally he also took a shot at syrian refugees trump in kinston nc the refugee program would leave us with generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism inside our shores 
 ashley killough killoughcnn october   
if youre keeping score at home african americans who stand up to trumps offensive campaign message are thugs and syrian refugees who come to the united states  in most cases women and children simply seeking a better life  are terrorists who will do damage to our country for generations 
a man who has such disdain for so many americans has no business being president of the united states"
153,"earlier i skewered nine dictators thugs demagogues and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy ethics and hygiene here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong
franklin delano roosevelt 
how the world remembers fdr led america through the great depression and wwii remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats
the ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression  all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement system
social security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending  however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens  americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying  and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy
fdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii  meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded
if that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly  billion in food weaponry and other supplies about  billion adjusted for inflation
at the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out  when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began winston churchill said we slaughtered the wrong pig if only roosevelt had listened to his generals
fdr wasnt a communist but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were later joseph mccarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them
walter cronkite 
how the world remembers he was a longtime cbs anchorman reporting many triumphs and tragedies a friendly face on living room tvs for decades he became everyones uncle walter according to polls he was the most trusted man in america
the ugly truth although a decent fellow in person cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist  spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it is
until cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own  of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters 
if that wasnt bad enough  his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen roses
many forget that the  paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford administration couldnt persuade congress to respond appropriately to a shit test by north vietnam then they invaded and saigon fell all thats a long story but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help that affected americas prestige abroad along with the lives of millions of south vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps 
allen ginsberg 
how the world remembers he was a pioneer of the beatniks much beloved by the hippies who followed and lauded with several literary prizes some even credit him with basically starting the s counterculture singlehandedly
the ugly truth ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate he wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes really but the rest isnt much better anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend believed the hype and didnt read it or dropped too much acid
howl his bestknown poem begins i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness a brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best minds
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism
who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down and wailed down wall and the staten island ferry also wailed
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of atlantic and caribbean love
who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may 
even overlooking the lunacy buggery and butthurt ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy back when poetry meant keats and kipling it rhymed and had meter
he was a noted critic of the usa for example
america i used to be a communist when i was a kid im not sorry
ginsberg visited several communist countries getting himself deported from some of them for immorality he abandoned his ancestral faith for buddhism and had a hare krishna phase what people believe is up to them of course but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake
granted ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents s still what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural marxism running out of talented writers
if that wasnt bad enough ginsberg joined the north american manboy love association sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf explaining in an accurately titled interviewpolitics pederasty and consciousnessto the harvard crimson 
as i get older having very specialised sexual tastes it gets harder to make out i like young boys why id have more chance at making out with younger guys if i were younger dewier dewylimbed
the media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates and screeched about donald trumps yearsold private locker room talk but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys 
ted kennedy best friends forever east and west
how the world remembers he was the lion of the senate representing massachusetts from  until his death in  this champion of social justice carried on the kennedy legacyhailed as americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain
the ugly truth he was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice but the suckers kept reelecting him his lack of character sank way deeper though all the way underwater
after a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites  and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reach
as for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of  was the most notorious he promised the public 
first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs 
the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future  just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting him
if that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb  he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that walter cronkite see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropov
john lennon 
how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts  anyway and the conscience of the world
the ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album  revolution  really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas double fantasy  critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant
lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put it
imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement
being under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this
if that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do that
another item was his extensive substance abuse he spent  guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head then
lennon do you know who i am
waitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his forehead
one lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroin
jimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havana
how the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerance
the ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to study
carters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something right
carters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket
worse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had threatened force in the beginning yep carter failed irans shit test consequentially the usa lost tons of international prestige and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily
if that wasnt bad enough carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators  worse clinton trusted him to represent the usa during disarmament talks with north korea they gave him the potemkin village show he bought it hook line and sinker yet again carter was played for a chumpthe usa opened its wallet and gave north korea aid and they pinkyswore to stop their nuclear program now the norks have nukessurprise awesome job mister nice guy

citis chief political analyst tina fordham has had a busy month 
at the start of october  when trumps victory odds were in the gutter and a clinton presidency had been priced in  in a hotly debated statement she suggested that the establishment may be approaching the us presidential completely incorrectly this is an unusual juncture but we keep looking at it through the same kinds of lenses what if its all wrong because society technology opinion polling methods and everything else dont capture marginalized voters in the way they might once have 
according to fordham the us presidential race felt more like an election in a developing nation where public distrust in government is high and conspiracy theories are rife markets seem unaware how much that low trust raises the risk of an antiestablishment vote fordham has focused on the gallup world poll on public health which analyzes two decades worth of health records of trump supporters the numbers show a correlation between the increase in the number of people going through difficult times  as measured by suicide rates depression mental illness and drug addiction  and the rise in trumps popularity fordham said 
this is the kind of thing that investors just dont normally run into but it provides another useful way to think about things because income inequality is necessary but not sufficient she said there is something more subtle going on about public expectations and exhaustion and a sense of corruption elite abuse of power and lack of control 
her conclusion was troubling for clinton fans  im getting this brexity feeling and i know other investors are as well she said the thinking is i didnt expect brexit so i better assume trump is going to win that element of investor psychology is at play here 
she followed up on monday  when she predicted that the fbis friday announcement could have a meaningful impact on the presidential race and cautioned that this may not be the end of it we continue to emphasize the potential for more black swan events emerging making things more complicated for forecasters and pollsters 
today in her latest media appearance fordham has penned an oped for the ft looking at the postelection landscape and warning that  investors face political risk whoever wins in the us election  
she first analyzes if a a clinton victory will mean business as usual for america and the global order and responds  not so fast 
investors should brace themselves for the new form of advanced economy political risk what ever the outcome of the us presidential election 
first any market relief from a victory for mrs clinton over donald trump her republican opponent will almost certainly be followed by the realization that a divided congress will mean a return to gridlock and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling with little prospect for reform 
more broadly following the vote in the uk to leave the eu the rise of mr trump and according to a yougov study authoritarian populism politics in advanced economies are having what might be termed an emerging markets moment vox populi risk a concept i formulated in  after a wave of protests coups and the rise of nonmainstream political parties has become a global phenomenon 
she then notes that the economic and market implications of advanced economy political risks are more likely to become systemically significant than their emerging markets counterparts according to the international monetary funds recently published world economic outlook political risk in the advanced economies has become the biggest threat to global growth 
specifically she envisages the trump campaign 
from threats to jail opponents on corruption charges to the proliferation of conspiracy theories the trump campaign and its supporters have borrowed heavily from the em political playbook sowing doubts not only about his opponents suitability for office but also about us political institutions a majority of republicans now say they believe the election will be rigged according to data from pew research center despite the lack of any precedent in us election history for such claims 
reverting to her notion that the us election looks a lot like that of a developing nation she notes that  what links this advanced economy political risk with its em cousin is low trust in institutions and elites  political and business elites expertsand the media it is trust plus belief in the future not growth alone that immunizes the body politic against the populist virus the collapse of trust is also evident in the sheer number of outright lies the factchecking website politifact has tracked during the campaign if everything is bogus than anything goes  
there are also the market implications 
the reaction of financial markets may be the starkest illustration of this change in trend according to the brookings institution the effect of mr trumps candidacy has been to give rise to price movements suggesting that a trump victory would reduce the value of the sp  and lead to a  per cent decline in the mexican peso as well as pricing in future volatility 
however fordhams punchline has little to do with a trump victory but rather the consequences of another clinton presidency 
mr trump may be heading for defeat but the prevalence of low trust identity politics and demographic divides across the developed world suggests that he will not be the last nonmainstream candidate to come close to power  this constellation of risks will be in evidence before elections next year in germany france and the netherlands and will have a significant impact on brexit negotiations moreover a clinton presidency is highly likely to be marked by nearcontinuous investigations as well as the risk of impeachment 
if citi is right the preelection circus and endless drama and theatrics is just the beginning of what is about to be unleashed a world in which the political realities of dm and em worlds will converge the new normal in advanced economies looks a lot like the emerging markets old normal but with considerably higher stakes for the global economy we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  click for details

160,"end of the american dream october   
if you want to see war without end vote for hillary clinton it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as dangerous and temperamental because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable 
she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades  hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over 
someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump according to reuters  trump recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
on syrias civil war trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict 
clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets 
what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it 
and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians 
according to national intelligence director james clapper  that could have dire consequences 
russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground clapper said speaking with cbs charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues 
of course clapper is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war  
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants 
you see the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all 
thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide 
so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control 
one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates  
mrs clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr trump on the other hand calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin said 
naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted 
anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality 
and even now the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland estonia latvia and lithuania  nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as americas troubled relationship with russia enters new uncertain territory a usled battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multination operation british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania 
in addition infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia 
after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad 
a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic 
the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen søreide 
most americans arent aware of any of this nor do they really care about our relationship with russia 
but in russia things are completely different the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days  and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  
russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities 
at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back 
the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials said were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats 
i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war 
in my controversial new book  i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming but at the time that i wrote it i didnt know how the election would turn out 
at this point it looks like clinton is very likely to win on november th and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia 
if you are reading this and you are considering voting for hillary clinton please dont do it  we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time 
if the american people do choose hillary clinton this november i believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly bitterly regret in future years this article was posted thursday october   at  am share this article"

164,"by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college
like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was
soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved
after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime
i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly
i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor
welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process
the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by 
 according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand
 the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties
 entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade
i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled
what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work
the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability
qualifications 
welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good
additional facts 
despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt
perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts
 you will always have employment as a welder
 welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders
 at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door
 welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions
 welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright
 welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world
conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit
further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen

167,"mutiny at the fbi comey warned by his own agents to indict clinton or watch the fbis reputation go down in flames 
monday october   tags james comey  fbi mutiny  clinton investigation naturalnews as america inches toward open revolt over the runaway criminality and collusion of the democrats and the media  another kind of revolt is taking place inside the fbi according to multiple sources in the independent media  now the only remaining free press in america  fbi director james comey was forced into announcing a reopening of the criminal investigation into hillary clintons private email server by livid fbi agents who threatened to go public if comey didnt actjames comey long since suspected to be a clinton operative who deliberately allowed hillary clinton to get away with a vast number of felony crimes and national security violations now finds himself with his back against the wall if he releases the evidence against hillary clinton already possessed by the fbi he will face the wrath of obama the clintons the corrupt loretta lynch doj and the entire leftist media if he once again gives hillary clinton a free pass on her numerous crimes he then faces a mutiny inside the fbi which promises to bypass his authority and leak the criminal evidence directly to the alternative media fbi agents under comey are desperately trying to save their agency from going down in flames agents inside the fbi in other words refuse to allow james comey to let the agency go down in flames as just another corrupt branch of the clinton crime family via the daily mail uk  james comeys decision to revive the investigation of hillary clintons email server and her handling of classified material came after he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents in the fbi  including some of his top deputies according to a source close to the embattled fbi director this dovetails with my own sources who tell me that the recent acquittal of the oregon ranchers has also driven a stake through james comeys reputation as he is the fbi official who reportedly ordered the execution of robert lavoy finicum whose suspected execution by fbi agents was caught on tape because the oregon ranchers have now been acquitted by a jury it means fbi head james comey seems to have ordered the shooting and killing of an innocent man under comey  and to the dismay of the many great agents working inside the fbi  comey may have turned the agency toward a lawless armed tyranny that guns down innocent americans while letting corrupt criminal politicians go free for many fbi agents who have spent their entire careers serving the fbi as honest dedicated federal agents the thought of allowing james comey to singlehandedly commit political arson and burn down the fbis hardwon reputation is just too much to bearresignations are beginning to pile up on comeys desk as livid fbi agents head for the exitsvia the daily mail the atmosphere at the fbi has been toxic ever since jim announced last july that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against hillary said the source a close friend who has known comey for nearly two decades comey told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents the letters reminded him every day that morale in the fbi had hit rock bottom and while the decision to reopen the case may appease fbi agents and republicans in the shortterm we suspect it does very little to restore overall faith in his competence as such we continue to question just how long comey can hold out before being forced to resign his post adds zero hedge  at a bare minimum in light of his continued questionable judgement and serious doubts raised about the integrity of the first investigation we fail to understand how an independent investigation into hillarys email server isnt warranted james comey is an arsonist and hes going to burn the fbi to the ground unless his agents mutiny the upshot of all this is that james comey is an arsonist if his own agents dont force him to apply the law to the clinton investigations comey will burn the agency to the ground leaving its reputation in ashes and that sadly will make the world a very dangerous place for all the fbi agents in the field because everyday americans would begin to see them all as corrupt lawless tyrants working as part of a criminal regime in washington that refuses to apply laws to its own kindthe truth is that most fbi agents are hard working professional men and women who are desperately trying to shut down the operations of terrorists financial fraudsters kidnappers murderers and other dangerous criminals yet if james comey doesnt defend the fbis reputation by indicting hillary clinton  he will likely be placing fbi field agents in grave danger as they face the wrath of citizens who begin to see them all as part of a corrupt criminal tyranny run by the political mafia in dccomey in other words is more dangerous to the entire fbi than any other single person in washington right now if he doesnt find his moral compass and guide the fbi through this crisis with law and order intact hes going to go down in history and in flames as the man who forever destroyed the credibility of the fbi and likely turned his field agents into ready targets for an enraged populaceno doubt hell get an extra bonus from loretta lynch if he once again decides to nullify the rule of law in america and announce that hillary wont be subject to the same laws that would immediately ensnare anyone else remember if comey gives hillary clinton a free pass he demonstrates to all americans that lawlessness is now the accepted standard of conduct in washington  and if our political leaders will not be held to account for their crimes then practically speaking why should any citizen feel compelled to follow any federal laws at all james comey if you want to salvage the fbis reputation announce a recommendation for the indictment of both hillary clinton and loretta lynch if theres one thing abundantly clear in all this its that both hillary clinton and loretta lynch should be behind bars  clinton is a lifelong criminal and mafia boss lynch is a thirdrate attorney who was tossed into the doj solely because of her gender and skin color not her credentials and neither one respects the laws of america of course both are deeply corruptif the fbi hopes to have any reputation remaining after the hillary clinton campaign implodes either before or on november th comey needs to come out strong right now and lay out the evidence that unambiguously shows hillary clinton had clear intent to violate national security laws  among other serious crimesall comey would have to say is something like in the view of the fbi hillary clinton is clearly not qualified to serve as commander in chief and we recommend she be indicted for violations of national security and so on with a single sentence comey could reinvigorate the fbi and position himself as an historic american heroright now id imagine the clinton machine is mailing bloody body parts in tiny wooden coffins to james comeys home address along with notes that say something like youre next lets watch and see if he grows a spine and refuses to be intimidated"

171,"according to john kaminski the new boss is the same as the old boss forget it if thats what you think kaminski says youre kidding yourself 
presidentelect donald trumps claim he is reinvestigating  is just so much meaningless hot air  more neocon crapola  if he intends to solve the greatest crime in american history by including two of the events participating perpetrators  rudy giuliani and lewis eisenberg  on his team of detectives 
what kind of truth can we expect from this kind of sandbagged scrutiny none at all once again our government is investigating itself with predictable results it will do no better than the first time  which was a total whitewash because it is the very system itself that all these political functionaries are trying to defend which bears responsibility for this event and its impact on history 
hiring the people who played minor supporting roles in the  bloodbath to identify its architects and actors may yield a few sacrificial scapegoats like cheney and some generals but the top of the line power structure will remain solidly in place hidden from view and utterly in control of world events 
that trump has surrounded himself with the tainted players who have carried out all these wars for israel augurs for a dark future in which the militarization of america will further shrink individual rights and the harsh crackdown on legitimate dissent  which will soon be banned  plainly signals the end of free speech as we have known it in the united states 
recall thomas jeffersons dictum freedom of the press cannot be limited without being lost today it is long gone the press prints only what the government allows it to print 
for trump to hire such rancid refugees from the bush administration means that he wont be investigating  instead he will be crafting a new more realistic coverup that lambastes saudi renegades and totally omits the overwhelming presence of israeli jews in all aspects of the tragedy  the same presence that now dominates the us government and its criminal activities throughout the world 
preemptive war is criminal activity in case you didnt know the us is practicing it everywhere under the cynical guise of fighting terror which it itself creates by hiring thugs from around the world to fit into the proper terror slots and become believable enemies for the press to vilify and our military to bomb 
the us has literally slaughtered millions of people around the world at the behest of a small group of mostly jewish men and the gentiles they have bought who control not only virtually all the money of the people in the world but also control their thoughts as a result 
mayor giuliani ran the command post in building  you remember building  that building that was knocked down by not being hit by an airplane giuliani knows everything that happened and who did what 
eisenberg one of the worlds foremost financiers was the head of the new york port authority who leased the twin towers to silverstein silverstein who spoke frequently with top israeli leaders wound up with  billion 
the question with regard to trumps integrity kind of splits down the middle since he seems to have a genuine desire to succeed and restore the peace but he is indebted to forces far larger than himself which he is now trying to placate by surrounding himself with the traditional pseudo republican goons like gingrich and romney 
if only they were genuine republicans it wouldnt be so bad but theyre poseurs all ultimately working for the rockefellers and the rothschilds 
business as usual in the jewish american empire gnawing on the fatted calf while   bleeds 
trumps choices reveal a desire to continue the swashbuckling sadism of the bush administration throughout his campaign i always shuddered when trump would proclaim that we needed a stronger military and i thought tell that to the people beneath the bombs because they want no part of any of this 
as a newspaper blows trivial events into earthshaking issues so politicians identify all manner of enemies that demonstrate the desperate need for them to be elected 
like the boston marathon bombing that turned a mercenary drill into a region wide suspension of freedom of movement the worst story possible is presented even as inconvenient facts are left behind 
think about the atrocities and false flag shockers that have been foisted on us since  statistics reveal that more than  of significant terror incidents began life as fbi sting operations manipulating low iq bigmouths into capital crimes 
why is it the cops can commit crimes against the people but the people cant commit crimes against the cops this is not the kind of freedom we thought wed get while growing up 
trump certainly is not addressing any of these issues and a trump administration will merely continue the clumsy depredations and smokescreen lies that have exemplified the utterly corrupt and criminal nature of the united states as it is run by jews bankers holed up in the city of london and wreaking havoc throughout the world by their control of everyones money 
what is really needed is a full accounting of what the jews have done to the united states and restitution to united states citizens over moneys illegally stolen by the federal reserve corporation to be taken from its stockholders immediately 
of course this is impossible because the jews own the government and all the corrupt minions within it one word from them and youre out of a job 
the avaricious jews are really only a reflection of the darker side of humanity like good sociopaths they learned everything they know by mimicking others and have become better than everyone else at what they do simply by practice and cooperation 
they have never once considered that the fate of the world ultimately depends on treating everyone in the world as members of your own family even as that becomes impossible on a continent overrun by hungry savages who were put there by these very same sadists who control the united states and its fearsome war machine 
a war machine that is now being used against its own people  through media medicine and food  as the people who control everything consolidate their hold on a population rapidly being shaped into the cattle our hebrew herders have always called us disclaimer all articles comments and videos published on this website reflect the views of their original authors and in no way necessarily mirror the outlook of anyone associated with this website video   mins"
172,"black turnout soft in early voting boding ill for hillary clinton jeremy peters et al new york times november   
africanamericans are failing to vote at the robust levels they did four years ago in several states that could help decide the presidential election creating a vexing problem for hillary clinton as she clings to a deteriorating lead over donald j trump with election day just a week away 
snip 
the reasons for the decline appear to be both political and logistical with lower voter enthusiasm and newly enacted impediments to voting at play in north carolina where a federal appeals court accused republicans of an almost surgical assault on black turnout and republicanrun election boards curtailed earlyvoting sites black turnout is down  percent  white turnout however is up  percent democrats are planning an aggressive final push including a visit by president obama to the state on wednesday 
but in florida which extended early voting after long lines left some voters waiting for hours in  africanamericans share of the electorate that has gone to the polls in person so far has decreased  to  percent today from  percent four years ago 
the problems for democrats do not end there in ohio which also cut back its early voting voter participation in the heavily democratic areas near cleveland columbus and toledo has been down though the clinton campaign said it was encouraged by a busy day on sunday when africanamerican churches led voter drives across the state 
snip 
the clinton campaign believes it can close the gap especially in north carolina and florida by election day and democrats are seeing substantial gains in turnout for other key constituencies like hispanics and collegeeducated women which have the potential to more than make up for any dropoff in black voting

176,"breaking bombshell fbi nypd insiders leak  email scandal about to take a sick and twisted turn    
source victurus libertas  


all of the following information was given to us by our insiders who have specific firsthand knowledge of the hillary clinton email scandal it seems that things are about to heat up we are told that of the  emails lifted from anthony weiners computer  emails are huma abedins and pay to play  including saudis and israelis meaning huma was the one hillary used to communicate with foreign leaders via email for inside information and deals via humas computer 

it has been established through many avenues but mainly through wikileaks that the clinton foundation was just a farce set up in order to perform paytoplay games with multiple entities including foreign nations paytoplay nations include israel saudi arabia turkey qatar kazakhstan and the ukraine 
furthermore we are told by one of our insiders that one email unequivocally confirms isis was created by cia and israeli secret intelligence service  with help from joe lieberman john mccain and lindsey graham an nypd insider said the content they viewed did include state department top secret emails one file was called life insurance a second file was titled  dnc nuclear arsenal  

a third file im sure hillary definitely does not want released was a file labeled intimate  according to this nypd insider this file contained xrated photos of huma and hillary with a teenager  

nypd detectives were sickened by what they saw according to our insider and they had threatened fbi field agents that they would leak this information if the fbi did not step up and take off the kid gloves  at that point  of the fbi agents in nyc were also threatening to leak the information 

as you can imagine the scandal has the entire obama administration in full panic we are told there are emails that could send loretta lynch to prison  as well as bill and hillary the twitter post below our sources sent us verifying it is all true 




even more 

the following information comes straight from an fbi anonymous source who is the senior analyst who posted on chan in early july of this year 

jim comey learned that some of his own investigators were tipping off both loretta lynch and bill clinton thus making his job impossible 

comey sent a letter to congress knowing that ultimately it would expose loretta lynch as a dirty actor and the breadcrumbs would lead directly to obama  the state department is terrified now comey has assembled a small team of  agents whom he has declared the untouchables after the famous federal agent eliot ness 

comey has clamped down on all fbi agents and he expects a fullscale war between the fbi and the department of justice doj the white house and the state department he has confirmed and understands that many sitting senators congressmen lobbyists and power players are going to be indicted and prosecuted  one of the main targets of the probe is the clinton foundation and clinton global initiative among the targets under investigation are john podesta huma cheryl mills cnn abc nbc etc 

as it turns out weiner humas husband had been forwarding humas emails each time she came home and left her computer open huma appears to have been in touch with saudi actors and therefore espionage is strongly suspected 
comey and his   untouchables  are now preparing to take down the largest corruption ever witnessed in american history which is what i think must happen if comey is planning to stay part of the fbi he lost so much respect and so much credibility with the first hillary investigation it would take something of this magnitude to allow him to face the public again the pentagon has internal players and outside players they call  creatives  creatives are civilians who tend to be geniuses malcontents extreme hackers or otherwise demonstrate brilliance in other useful areas a pentagon program called cicada   which we have reported on previously was created by several of these talented civilians the program is now used to allow thousands of honest government people to report on their corrupt superiors using what is called a dead box whistleblower encryption method so the noncorrupted government officials can report corruption and still remain safe 

ive heard it said a vagina almost took down bill now will a weiner take down hillary lol 

again thank you to all of the insiders the whistleblowers the good fbi agents the good cia agents the good nypd officers and the noncorrupted government officials who want to see the truth exposed without these brave wonderful and morally erect individuals our country would still be in the corrupted darkness

177,"the washington post reported  
donald trump raised just  million for his presidential campaign committee in the first  days of october about half as much as his democratic rival putting him at a severe financial disadvantage in the crucial final days of the white house contest new campaign finance reports filed thursday night showed 
the gop presidential nominee had just  million left in his campaign coffers on oct  compared to hillary clintons  million when the cash reserves of their joint fundraising committees are included clintons war chest grew to  million while trumps totaled  million 
trumps total fundraising dropped  in the first  days of october  million is close to nothing for a national presidential campaign in the closing weeks of the race at a time when trump needs boots on the ground to get out the republican vote his presidential campaign is broke and in debt to the tune of  million there isnt going to be a lastminute ad blitz for trump or a reservation of television time so that the republican nominee can speak directly to voters before election day 
the plan for trump is for the campaign to continue to limp along with lots of rallies which are good for trumps ego but not effective in getting voters to the polls trump promised to donate  million to his campaign but has only given  million  the billionaire who promised to selffinance has run his presidential campaign into the ground trump took ten times more money out of his campaign in reimbursements to his own businesses than he gave in october 
fundraising is an indicator of expected election outcomes the money tends to go towards the winner at the end of an election hillary clinton is having no trouble raising money which suggests that enthusiasm is high among her supporters trumps cash crush points to a depressed base that doesnt expect him to win 
trump has done what he does best he talked a big game while bankrupting the republican party for his own personal gain convincing republicans to give him their nomination may go down in history as trumps biggest con of all"

there are those who think we should only get our news from official sources you know like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game 
if theres anything the  election showed us its that the american people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining usa 
in response the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control the internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry ie cnn abc cbs nbc et al because they have learned the american people know how full of shit they really are 
sites like return of kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last  years hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative 
make no mistake one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to having julian assange and edward snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes  
fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the internet we can be thankful trump won the election rather than the bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down 
the new york times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the internet only days after the bitch lost the election publisher arthur sulzberger published a mea culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting 
we cannot deliver the independent original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers the new york times promises to give the news impartially without fear or favor we also approach the incoming trump administration without bias 
dont buy into it this is whats known in public relations as a diversion tactic while we focus on our seeming victory theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news no sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give trump a chance the new york times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites 
while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere 
they did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at trump rallies never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock stock and barrel on fake news almost every narrative they create is a false one one need do no more than a google search to discredit many if not most of the mainstream medias stories the hypocrisy is astounding pulling the plug facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online 
whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online then follow through with the hegelian dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it 
look for no less than a figurative internet  if the elite become desperate enough 
theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the internet shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days blame it on a fake news story just like benghazi was blamed on a youtube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our bill of rights protections 
make no mistake freedom of speech is the most important of amendments to the constitution once that is taken away its game over obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of trump 
obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites this is nothing more than proposing the creation of the american equivalent of pravda in the soviet union in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies obviously the new world order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced 
check out what the messiah said in berlin recently 
in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television where some overzealousness on the part of a us official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems 
the fact he is saying these things should frighten you it should also make you angry this statement is a pc way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up they want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government 
we must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake internet  designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very libertarian internet of today"

an elite stratum of wealthy and politically dominant people intends to make hillary clinton our next president these are the oligarchs the  whose wealth and incomes continue growing while most american struggle in her private life hillary clinton is wellpositioned among this cohort and they expect her as president to protect their wealth and maintain their dominance she will
to assure the oligarchs success the democratic national committee is brutalizing the presidential electoral process willfully violating rules laws and precedent the strategy succeeded in the primary elections and it will win the general
who are these people the top  of wealthholders numbers about  million predominantly they are citizens whose wealth depends on the huge american domestic and transnational corporations either directlyexecutives directors investors contractors suppliersor indirectly in other ways eg investment bankers hedge fund managers consultants top law firms two preeminent names in this grouping are hillary and bill clinton whose net worth about  million qualifies the couple for the  stratum by a factor of  others are wall street bankersthe clintons primal financial benefactors and firstname friends lloyd blankfein jamie dimon robert rubin brian moynihan michael corbat james gorman timothy geithner john stumpf etc a more accurate description of the  would be the corporate elite 
candidate clintons relationship to her elite compatriots is one of rigid interdependence she needs their financial and political resources to win the election and they need her in the white house to sustain their privileged status
this privileged status did not result from accident random chance or neglect it is a consequence of public policies consciously adopted over the past three or four decades which shift wealth and incomes systematically upward cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy for example while exporting  of the nations manufacturing jobs in the process our democracy was transformed public policy is crafted today not primarily to advance the welfare of the nations people but to create protect or enhance the financial interests of american corporate enterprise this is acknowledged in the statements of public figures and supported in rigorous scholarly research 
more a new email investigation on clinton could hasten the democratic partys demise the banana republic of america democracy be damned to the superdelegates stand tall in statesmanship anointment of hillary clinton exposes a democracy that never was though easily identifiable the corporate elite has not constructed a conscious conspiracy against the american people at large with a preplanned agenda strategy and tactics but they share a common mindset they are networked by personal acquaintance and they are driven by a common imperative their wealth and political dominance depend on the existing configurations of american domestic and foreign policy both of which must be maintained essentially intact to sustain the groups position of privilege alterations in the status quo can be tolerated only if they are cosmetic slight and at the margin
instead of conspiracy the preeminence of the oligarchs is better seen as a malignant condition of contemporary american government resulting from years of institutional decay and corruption  the story of moribund democracy is detailed here  the economic and political power of megacorporationsincreasingly fewer but ever largerhas displaced functional democracy
yes we vote as we always have but voting and democracy are not interchangeable terms the russian people voted for vladimir putin the iraqis voted for saddam hussein and voting isnt a prerequisite for democracy to function the ancient greeks chose their representatives by lottery
the priority of corporate interests has been achieved by three powerful mechanisms
perhaps the least recognized is the degree to which corporate personnel enter government to staff the highest levels of the executive branch
a new book by political scientists bastiaan van apeldoorn and nana de graaff carries a sobering title american grand strategies and corporate elite networks  they looked into the grand strategy makers the  most influential people in cabinetlevel and senior advisory positions in the last three administrationsbill clintons bushs and obamas in the clinton administration  of the  grand strategy makers  were linked to  different transnational or financial corporations as executives directors senior associates or partners in law firms either prior to their public service or after it in the bush administration  of the   had connections to  corporations in the obama administration  of the  over  had such toplevel corporate affiliations with  companies
smoking guns examples of wealthshifting upward to the already rich certainly  the repeal of the glasssteagall act rammed through in the bill clinton administration by treasury secretary robert rubin from citigroup this enabled the subprime loan frenzy enriching the new york banks but destroying  trillion in americans household wealth  halliburtons nobid obscenely profitable contracts in iraq served up by vice president richard cheney during the bush administration billions of taxpayers dollars to the corporation mr cheney once chaired  in the obama administration treasury secretary timothy geithner from wall street administered the troubled asset relief program bailing out his colleagues banks again with billions of taxpayers money
for the last  years the executive branch has been dominated by the corporate elite
two other mechanisms of corporate influence are far more familiar the corporate financing of political campaigns and the ubiquitous enterprise of lobbying
the two practices are related in direct proportion the more you accept in contributions from boeing say the more you feel obligated to yield to their lobbyists wishes
your policymaking independence will decrease then as the costs of campaigning rise and contemporary costs are staggering a representative today must raise on average  million in campaign funding a senator  million a presidential race runs in the hundreds of millions hillary clinton has taken in  million since citizens united corporate campaign funding has no limits and with candidates in need of so many millions the corporate capture of federal governance is undeniable and scarcely surprising
undeniable but easily surmounted we once had a law on the books the uk still does limiting not campaign contributions but campaign expenditures the limits were  for a senate race  for a representative sums easily provided from personal assets and those of family and friends reenacting such a law would break the corporate stranglehold intense lobbying might continue but no senator no representative would feel the courteous urge to accommodate the welfare of the american people could regain priority the impact on the oligarchs however would be apocalyptic
the commitment of the corporate elite to sustain the status quo is apparently absolute by april of  the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign were one indistinguishable juggernaut intent on blitzing the presidential campaign like hitlers wehrmacht stormed through europe the watch words seemed to be first and most they amassed an early warchest of a hundred million dollars or so and lined up  superdelegate endorsementsall before there was a single announced opponent they invited  print and television journalists to meetings in early april to help in framing the hrc message and framing the race  among them were george stephanoplous and  others from abc rachel maddow and  more from msnbc gloria borger and  of her colleagues from cnn and  from the new york times bloomberg politico and cbs each sent along two
the firstandmost strategy worked secretary clinton preempted the candidate space the only others attracted to the race were lackluster lightweights especially the wooly socialist from vermont but senator sanders electrifying rallies made tangible the disgust of the american people with the status quo  sanders proposals were anything but cosmetic slight and at the margin they posed a mortal threat to the corporate elite and its guardian the clinton campaign to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games sanders had to sue to gain access to the dncs voter database the deliberate tilting of the democratic primaries gained momentum
to minimize sanders exposure dnc chair wassermanschultz limited the number of debates and scheduled them on weekends and opposite football games
this may not be the first election in which ethics and law were abandoned but never before has it been so reliably exposed
not by the mainstream media though they either ignored the increasingly evident fraud or were complicit in it from the iowa caucuses onward the press treated clintons superdelegate endorsements as tallied votes this continued even after the distortion and dishonesty of doing so were pointed out based on precisely that deception however the associated press announced clintons presumptive nomination on monday june one day before primaries were held in california montana new jersey north and south dakota and the district of columbia from iowa forward also the washington post and the new york times hammered the sanders campaign without mercy or interruption the story was detailed later by thomas frank in harpers magazine   frank concludes i have never before seen the press take sides like they did this year openly and even gleefully badmouthing candidates who did not meet with their approval 
no the major media failed to expose the fraud but the social media and the internet abounded with skepticism sanders fans questioned the uncounted caucuses in iowa the  reduction of polling places in maricopa county arizona the disqualified sanders delegates at the nevada convention the cheapshot call by the associated press many were certain the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee were joined at the hip but there was scant factual evidence
enter julian assange and the leaked dnc emails now the illegal collusion was documented the sabotaging of the sanders campaign exposed wassermanschultz resigns as dnc chair then the podesta emails and hillarys paid speeches you need both a public position and a private position my dream is a hemispheric open market with open trade and open borders dnc vicechair donna brazile a cnn pundit emails the clinton campaign prior to the debate from time to time i get the questions in advance the attempt to reschedule the illinois primary another tranche of emails arrives braziles complicity with the clinton campaign is broadened she is firedresigns from her cnn post the clinton foundation hosts pay to play the clintons personal enrichment the  million deal with king mohammed vi of morocco
finally the compliant mass media did take note this is after all fine spectacle noted but not pursued no determined effort was undertaken to investigate to document further the deceit and dishonesty and to assess its magnitude
once again that was left to the citizenry the first careful detailed study was published june   by two scholars axel geijel of tilburg university and rodolfo cortes barragan at stanford it is entitled are we witnessing a dishonest election they compared states whos voting systems produced verifying paper trails against states which did not sanders won the papertrail states where tampering with machine tallies could be quickly discovered clinton overpowered in states without paper trails where tampering could never be detected the authors also compared voting machine tallies with exit poll figures and found disturbing discrepancies they concluded these data suggest that election fraud is occurring in the  democratic party presidential primary election this fraud has overwhelmingly benefited secretary clinton at the expense of senator sanders the paper can be found here 
then with the primaries concluded a group of outraged patriots with day jobs organized as election justice usa  published an exhaustive report the study is entitled democracy lost a report on the fatally flawed  democratic primaries  and it is available here  it details in  pages of carefully assembled and compelling evidence examples of election fraud uncovered in four categories voter suppression registration tampering illegal voter purging and fraudulent voting machine tallies in eleven states the group found discrepancies between exit polls and voting machine counts exceeding the statistical margins of error every single discrepancy favored secretary clintonand no such discrepancies occurred in the republican counts the groups conclusion was troubling  elected delegates their report argues persuasively were awarded fraudulently to clinton and denied sanders accordingly
that gave her the edge in delegate count going into the convention in the end however she needed the additional votes of  unelected superdelegates those empowered by the democratic national committee even after a primary season documented as fraudulent then hillary clintons nomination was achieved by fiat not democracy
but the corporate elite will not be denied given the clintondnc expertise and success in tipping the primary elections she will be elected president in the general election guaranteed
the manipulation of the primaries was obscure but not invisible a backlash of outrage might have been anticipated the clintondnc people however are unmatched in hubris and geniuses in the practice of deceit scandals were not even acknowledged defiantly ignored and the language of progressive democracy is omnipresent in the campaigning brilliant deception hillary clinton promises to work for main street not wall street she promises to bring back jobs improve education seek equal pay for women boost the minimum wage expand civil rights provide free college education move toward medicare for all oppose tpp break up the toobigtofail wall street banks fine appealing proposals all but this is the language of sanders revolution and the corporate elite will stand for none of it
but folk wisdom tells us to take campaign promises lightly and the american people are forgiving and trusting hillary clinton is a woman of long experience and we want to believe our democracy is robust
here now we need to be vigilant

185,"public faith in elections falls as the state grows outofcontrol state power ryan mcmaken  misesorg  october   comments 
in the wake of the final presidential election debate last week the mainstream media was appalled that donald trump would not preemptively agree to not contest the outcome of the election  
trumps position reflects a growing faction of americans who doubt the integrity and honesty of the american electoral system in response mainstream media sources have responded by vehemently insisting that rigged elections are  a myth  
while rarely stated explicitly the way american electoral politics is supposed to work is this the population spends several months listening to the candidates accuse each other of terrible crimes horrible ideas and gross incompetence each candidate lists the ways he or she will use the power of government to force the winners policy preferences on the losers then once the votes are cast everyone is supposed to quickly accept the results ignore everything that was said during the campaign and immediately accept the winner as having an indisputable mandate to rule over everyone including the sizable minority  or even the majority in many cases  who either voted against the winner or abstained if there appears to be any irregularities in the vote well those should just be ignored because it would tear the country apart to drag out the election if half the country feels its been cheated well tough luck and better luck next time democracy breaks down as perceived interventionism increases 
this model can only work indefinitely under certain specific conditions it can be workable when there is a perception that government is limited in its power and extensive or abrupt change to government institutions are thought to be rare it can also work in a small culturally uniform society where there is a relatively small divide between socioeconomic and ethnic groups 
in the case of the united states however it appears that neither of these conditions apply 
in the age of presidential executive orders militarized police uncountable federal laws and a myriad of spy agencies empowered to watch americans every move gone is the perception that a loss in an electoral contest should simply be accepted without question the president says he can issue laws with  a pen and  a phone  without any need to consult congress the libya war proved presidents can invade any country without so much as a debate in congress meanwhile the untouchable supreme court hands down decisions that are equivalent to constitutional amendments some of which can have enormous effects on the daily lives of ordinary citizens 
in other words the stakes are now reaching the point where an attitude of better luck next time doesnt cut it whether or not these fears are at times overstated is irrelevant the fact is the perception of democratic lawlessness is growing 
this situation is further complicated by the fact that the united states is an enormous conglomeration of different cultural and socioeconomic groups spread out over a vast and varied geography many of these different groups distrust each other and in a country where the president and the judiciary now rule largely by proclamation there is reason to be fearful when the other guys candidate wins and yours loses democracy can work when the stakes are low 
contrary to the naive musings of some nostalgic conservatives the united states was never united into a single cultural linguistic or socioeconomic group those differences may have reached a low point during the twentieth century but they were far larger in the th century than they are today 
when you have a diverse population however the problem of who controls the government becomes far more important and this concern grows as the state becomes more powerful writing on the topic of immigration and nationalism in australia  ludwig von mises noted how powerful states exacerbate the problem of cultural divides could a laissezfaire regime be guaranteed to all residents of australia mises notes it would not matter at all if there were cultural mistrust between englishdescended australians and asian newcomers however since laissezfaire liberalism has not been embraced a familiar problem presented itself 
the present inhabitants of australia fear that some day they could be reduced to a minority in their own country and that they would then have to suffer all the horrors of national persecution to which for instance the germans are today ie the early s exposed in czechoslovakia italy and poland 
it cannot be denied that these fears are justified because of the enormous power that today stands at the command of the state a national minority must expect the worst from a majority of a different nationality as long as the state is granted the vast powers which it has today and which public opinion considers to be its right the thought of having to live in a state whose government is in the hands of members of a foreign nationality is positively terrifying it is frightful to live in a state in which at every turn one is exposed to persecution  masquerading under the guise of justice  by a ruling majority it is dreadful to be handicapped even as a child in school on account of ones nationality and to be in the wrong before every judicial and administrative authority because one belongs to a national minority 
it is clear that no solution of the problem of immigration is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity or to that of the socialist state only the adoption of the liberal program could make the problem of immigration which today seems insoluble completely disappear in an australia governed according to liberal principles what difficulties could arise from the fact that in some parts of the continent japanese and in other parts englishmen were in the majority 
these same principles can be applied outside the subject of immigration as well the existence of an interventionist state means any country composed of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic groups faces the same problem of one group being exploited by another group with the help of state power change the term nationality to political party or interest groups and one has a fair approximation of the problem of democracy in any interventionist state 
in the presence of a relatively weak government however these concerns are often overstated at the turn of the th century in the us for example the fact that spanishspeakers were in the majority in new mexico and many areas of the american west was irrelevant to the lives of the vast majority of americans the fact that japanese immigrants and their descendant were outcompeting white businessmen in california was simply not a matter of national importance the fact that oregon attempted to outlaw catholic schools was not a matter for presidential executive orders thanks to widespread suspicion of federal power at the time the lack of a strong federal judiciary and a relatively weak presidency meant these issues remained largely local while public policy was haphazard 
voters have always feared losses in elections but now more than ever the voters may be justified in refusing to simply accept the outcomes of elections under an interventionist state which meddles in every field of human activity when that is the case elections are not something to be taken lightly trumps remarks about rigged elections  and public fears over the outcome  are to be expected from voters with an immense fear of outofcontrol state power 
in response to all of this the pundits and government class will tell us that everyone must double down on democracy and that elections  specifically federal ones are sacred rituals never to be questioned there will be a double standard of course a trump victory will be questioned by the media and powerful politicians but in that case it will be the fault of the russians  and not anything wrong with the system itself the solution for the feds of course will be a federal takeover of the election system if clinton wins then no questioning of the system will be tolerated at all to question the outcome or the wisdom of these presidential contests will be denounced as scarcely less than sacrilege 
the true solution to the problem remains far more practical however to paraphrase mises it is clear that no solution of the problem of elections is possible if one adheres to the ideal of the interventionist state so long as elections are increasingly perceived to be referenda on which side shall use the power of the state to crush the other side faith in the electoral system will erode and the potential for real violence will increase newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles"

if you had wanted to give trump supporters the benefit of the doubt this most recent incident proves that its far too much to give them 
a yearold man in allen park michigan has just been charged with six felonies after he held six children at gunpoint because he thought theyd damaged the donald trump sign on his lawn yes this is the kind of deranged emotionally unstable supporters trump has attracted 
the man michael robert kubek had called police on october th to report that his trump sign had been hit by teenagers who had fled the scene when the police arrived at the scene they didnt find kubek at his home  however when the officers followed the screams coming from around the corner there he was 
the police saw kubek standing over six children ages  who were sitting on the grass kubek accused the children of destroying his sign despite the fact that he never actually witnessed them doing it the children denied any involvement and the officers told kubek to return to his house so they could speak to the children 
according to the kids they were simply on their way to the park for a birthday celebration when kubek had pulled out a gun and pointed it at them instructing them to sit down on the grass those witnessing the act took to social media to vent their shock twitter twitter 
the newsherald reported 
the officer asked him again if he could identify any of the kids as the one who damaged his sign but kubek repeated that he could not the officer then asked kubek if he pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the kids according to police kubek said yes 
in response to another question from the officer kubek said he felt threatened because he was outnumbered 
yes a grown man used a gun because he felt outnumbered by a small group of innocent kids this is exactly the type of unhinged person who shouldnt be trusted with firearms kubeks hearing is scheduled for december th  lets hope that whatever happens to kubek that he is no longer considered a responsible gun owner you can watch a report below

the only open question is whether the american people are ready to connect the dots in the last few months we have been reading that american jews are concerned by the sharp rise in antisemitism in the land of the free i guess that manyamerican jews have connected the dots already they grasp that once again jewish elite is playing a very dangerous game on their expense 

one would expect jews in general and jewish oligarchs in particular to draw the necessary conclusion from jewish history somehow this never happens the same disastrous mistakes are repeated as we know the consequences are grave"

a new report is painting cia director james comey as having used his office to influence the presidential election as comey sent a letter about hillary clintons emails but refused to call out russia for meddling in the election by hacking democrats 
cnbc reported  fbi director james comey argued privately that it was too close to election day for the united states government to name russia as meddling in the us election and ultimately ensured that the fbis name was not on the document that the us government put out a former fbi official tells cnbc 
 
according to the former official comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to a foreign power was trying to undermine the election he believed it to be true but was against putting it out before the election comeys position this official said was if it is said it shouldnt come from the fbi which as youll recall it did not 
director comey didnt want to interfere in the presidential election by releasing information that could harm republican presidential nominee donald trump but he had no qualms about sending a letter to congress about emails that he had never seen in an apparent effort to interfere in the current presidential election 
with each new revelation and detail it is becoming impossible not to come to the conclusion that fbi director comey may have violated the hatch act with his letter to congress it is illegal for federal employees to use their positions to interfere in elections 
when the information was bad for donald trump comey argued that it should not be publicly released so close to the election however he embraced a different standard when he had less information but could frame it in a way that could damage hillary clintons campaign 
it is becoming clear that comey has abused his power and must be removed as fbi director immediately"

the american people have repudiated the foreign policy of president barack obama and former secretary of state hillary clinton which was a complete disgrace for the united states according to james fetzer an american scholar and political analyst 
professor fetzer made the remarks in a phone interview with press tv on monday days after republican presidential nominee donald trump stunned the world by defeating the heavilyfavored democratic candidate hillary clinton in the november  election 
during the election campaign trump repeatedly expressed his willingness to work with russian president vladimir putin and other leaders in order to resolve global problems including the issue of daesh terrorism which he has blamed on the policies of the obama administration 
on the other hand clinton has shown eagerness to confront russia and continue the interventionist policies us administrations have practiced since  
professor fetzer said that clinton was behind the massacre of libya the butchery of benghazi the transfer of weapons to rebels in syria 
more than five years after the overthrow of muammar gaddafi libya has become a failed state with the central government holding no sway over the country and africas wealthiest nation has become a haven for terrorist organizations 
and since  the united states and its allies have been sponsoring terrorists wreaking havoc in syria 
professor fetzer stated that clinton was being advised by israeli intelligence telling her how to conduct american foreign policy it was a complete disgrace 
the american people have repudiated the foreign policy of barack obama and hillary clinton the scholar said 
donald trump is going to restore a measure of sanity he is going to end the wars in the middle east he is going to restore the reputation of the united states for integrity and dealing with the international community he noted 
he respects russia as should any president of the united states where barack obama and hillary clinton fell miserably short the analyst pointed out

while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

206,email yoda is a sick elderly reptile who lives alone at a motel in a swamp hes an absolute mess and hes incapable of looking after himself do you think you have what it takes to be his livein caretaker  before we get started you need to understand that this is not a glamorous job yoda is miserable to be around he needs constant supervision and his hygiene is appalling caring for him is an aroundtheclock gig and it requires an extraordinary level of patience and compassion youre going to have to put up with a lot of bullshit thats okay im confident i can handle whatever challenges the job throws my way wow that sounds pretty difficult i suppose id just have to try my best and hope i do a good job honestly i dont really have any experience with anything like this i already know that i would do a terrible job  one of the most important aspects of the job is tending to yodas skincare needs his skin is dry flaky and covered in sores and it needs to be rubbed down several times a day with a special prescription lotion unfortunately yoda hates being touched and he wont let you put the lotion on without a fight sometimes hell spray you with his stink gland or try to bite you other times hell scurry underneath the couch and try to dig a hole in the floor to hide in frantically scratching at the carpet until his hooves are bloody and raw with this in mind how would you go about getting him to cooperate with you for his skin treatments using simple terms he can understand id explain to him why the skin treatments are necessary and id work with him to figure out what exactly he doesnt enjoy about them and then use that information to tailor the process for him so that its as painless and comfortable as possible i would trap him underneath a laundry basket until he burns off all his combative energy then once hes tuckered out i would pin him to the floor with my knee and apply the lotion to his skin as quickly as possible before he gets a second wind id spread a thin layer of the lotion around the inside of a garbage bag then id roll a tennis ball past yoda to create a distraction and while his attention is diverted i would run over and stuff him inside the garbage bag id shake him up and down inside the bag until his body was covered in lotion and then i would dump him out on a mat of paper towels to clean off any excess lotion i would really rather not touch his gross skin so id probably just leave the lotion out on the counter for him  yoda always makes a huge fuss about eating his fruits and vegetables and if he had his way he would live entirely off of slim jims how would you ensure that hes eating a healthy nutritious diet and not just slim jims i would make him healthy vegetarian slim jims out of ground mushrooms spices lentils and other wholesome ingredientshe wouldnt be able to tell the difference i would dip all of his slim jims in nail polish remover to make them taste horrible leaving him no choice but to eat the vegetables if he doesnt want to go hungry i would tell him that his nemesis count dooku is coming to spay him and the only way for him to get strong enough to fight back is if he fills himself up on powerful vitamins and minerals like the ones found in fruits and vegetables i would mash the fruits and vegetables into a paste and force the paste down his throat with my fingers  yoda spends hours each morning tending to a patch of weeds out back that he refers to as his crops its pretty harmlesshe mostly just sprays the hose and drags a rake around a bitbut if you dont keep an eye on him hell sneak away and try to find the chosen one thats what he calls the trasheating swamp pelican that lives in the pond behind the house its unclear why he thinks this pelican is so special but hes already given it his lightsaber and all of his money in an effort to help it defeat the dark side this is all nonsense of course and its important to make sure yoda doesnt give any more of his valuables to this bird what measures would you take to keep yoda away from the chosen one i would tether him to the house with a length of rope thats long enough for him to freely tend to his crops but too short for him to wander off to places he shouldnt be i would dress yoda in a vest covered in flashing lights and bells which would scare the pelican away should it ever try to approach shock collar i would shoot the pelican with a gun and then make yoda eat its disgusting meat so that he realizes that the bird isnt special  theres nothing in the world that yoda enjoys more than watching pornography however doing so gets him extremely riled up and his doctor has warned that his heart is no longer strong enough to handle excitement like this nonetheless yoda will still try to watch porn any chance he gets and the only way to curb this habit is to reprimand him when he does how would you reprimand yoda for watching porn i would revoke his tv and computer privileges for the rest of the day and have him use his time to do something constructive instead i would put an oven mitt over his head and ducttape it in place so hed be physically incapable of looking at pornor anything else for that matter i would leave the oven mitt over his head for an entire day i would strip off all his clothes and parade him around town so that he could see how it feels to have strangers stare at him when hes naked i would charge people  to take pictures with naked yoda and i would spend all the money on something he hates i would put him in the oven and pretend like i was going to cremate him and i would only take him out if he promised to never look at porn again  one thing to be aware of is that yoda is very afraid of airplanes if he hears a commercial jet flying overhead hell freak out and try to use the force to make it crash granted hes probably not strong enough anymore to actually cause any harm but just be aware that thats a thing he might do got it ill make sure he doesnt try to down any airplanes if yoda wants to make an airplane crash who am i to stop him  yoda has no family or friends but he does have a catfish named obiwan that he keeps in a cigar box next to his bed he talks quietly to the catfish for several hours each night but what he doesnt realize is that the catfish is dead yodas doctor is concerned that hes formed an unhealthy attachment to the catfish and he has strongly suggested taking the catfish away from him before he becomes any more emotionally invested in it how would you go about taking yodas catfish away from him while also minimizing the emotional devastation that will result from losing his treasured companion i would get yoda a fishbowl and his very own pet goldfish once he has a real live fish to take care of i trust hell begin losing interest in obiwan and i will then gradually start weaning the dead fish out of his life while yoda is sleeping i would secretly put a small speaker inside of obiwans belly and wirelessly connect it to a microphone that i could use to make the dead catfish talk then the following day when yoda is having his alone time with obiwan i would have the catfish say yoda if you truly care about me please flush me down the toilet so i can go live with my family in the sewer hopefully he would feel comfortable parting with his companion if he thought it was what the dead catfish wanted i would tell yoda that count dooku is coming to make obiwan into a delicious po boy sandwich and the only way for him to thwart his nemesis is to run outside and toss obiwan into the swamp pond so he can swim away to safety i would throw obiwan in the trash and then lock yoda in a cupboard until he stops crying get results results for do you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker you have what it takes to be yodas livein caretaker wow sounds like this is the perfect gig for you looking after yoda is a very demanding job but your thoughtfulness and patience would be the perfect counterbalance to his unpleasant lifestyle and turbulent behavior the force is definitely on your side share your results

mohsen abdelmoumen  according to you when we see the numerous demonstrations antitrump in the united states after the election of donald trump at the presidency are we witnessing a colored revolution
wayne madsen it is classic sorosfunded color revolution soros is financing moveonorg black lives matter demos and other of his groups to turn out protesters and is even running ads in papers looking for paid drivers and protest coordinators
in your very relevant books devoted to george soros soros quantum of chaos you reveal the true face of this figure who is the spearhead of several destabilization operations in the world from where does all the power come that this criminal holds and why is he untouchable
soros is very wealthy and actually a frontman for an even more powerful and wealthy person evelyn de rothschild along with his family they are all the true puppet masters of the world
soros remains a major element in the antitrump device can trump resist him
more disrespecting the american imperial presidency trump won now what will america survive the next  years defeating white liberalism in the age of trump trump is actually now being surrounded by people who will serve in his administration who will be loyal to the sorosrothschild puppet masters and certainly not to trump
can we say that the occult world is more powerful than legal institutions
secret societies with their crazy rituals have been the bane of human existence since the time of the sanhedrin and pharisees in palestine and the dionysian cults of the nile valley and the mediterranean region
in your book  isis is us  the shocking truth behind the army of terror you detail the relations between the usa and isisdaesh what is the triggering element that has put you on this trail
trumps national security adviser retired lt gen michael flynn revealed that the us was supporting isis and then he was forced to resign my own sources in the middle east confirmed this long before flynn made his public statement and was fired as defense intelligence agency chief by obama
you mention western sahara and the involvement of the clintons in a deal with the kingdom of morocco while this case is under the authority of un arent the clintons outlaws such bonnie and clyde by supporting morocco against the sahrawi people and the uns resolutions
the clintons received at least  million from the moroccan government in return for buying their loyalty to moroccos agenda which includes permanently annexing western sahara as the southern province morocco and israel share the same policy on annexing illegallyoccupied territories
according to your diverse very interesting analysis can we assert that the world government or the false prophets of the new world order are the real decisionmakers of this world
i mentioned a few already sorosrothschild others are the bilderbergs bohemian club and the council on foreign relations and their counterparts
you know very well some american intelligence agencies like the nsa do these intelligence agencies serve the us interests or rather the oligarchys interests
the cia has always served the interests of wall street nsa now serves the interests of the global security network it leads
you were an officer in the us navy was the whistleblower you are today born after your military career or before
before i was an fbinavy whistleblower in  and helped to uncover a major pedophile ring in the us navy that reached into the reaganbush white house and was ultimately exposed in the washington times in  my whistleblowing cost me my navy career however and a subsequent series of fairly bad jobs
in the recent us election we saw the mass media bankruptcy despite their manipulations and their fake polls didnt one of the pillars of world oligarchy collapse under our eyes dont we witness a historic moment announcing the end of the new world order and its purely capitalist product globalization
 percent of major newspapers endorsed clinton many alternative news sources supported trump we are seeing a massive shift away from newspapers and corporate tv and websites to the alternative media of which waynemadsenreportcom has been prominent since its founding in 
snowden has denounced the prism program and you have denounced echelon both of which serve the interests of the worlds oligarchic caste what is known is not only the immersed part of the iceberg
what is still relatively unknown is the close cooperation between nsa and private companies like microsoft apple google facebook and major telecommunications companies it is much greater than even snowdens documents describe
the quantity and especially the quality of your reports reveal to us a world unknown by millions of human beings how all these truths have been hidden
the major media cooperates with the government in covering up news events
i advise everyone to read the wayne madsen report as well as your books and follow your various interventions in the alternative media how do you explain that we who are resisting to what i call the fascist oligarchic caste are called conspiracy theorists is this concept the only weapon of the fascist imperialists to reduce to silence all those who resist them and to reinforce the ranks of those whose who have been brainwashed
the term conspiracy theorist was developed by the cia in the mids to ridicule those who believed there was a wide government role in the assassination of president kennedy it has been used ever since to describe legitimate researchers into irancontra  and other deep state crimes
your book  the star and the sword  is one of the few to talk about intimate and opaque links between the zionist entity of israel and saudi arabia you claim that they organize false flag attacks including the  what is the origin and nature of this israelisaudi strategic alliance do you think that the jasta law will succeed or will it be countered by the zionist allies of saudi arabia do the fact that the usa and the westerners turn a blind eye on the criminal war led by the saudis to yemen isnt due to the weight of the lobby zionist
the zionistwahhabisaudi alliance goes back to ibn saud who wrote the british and zionist leaders that he did not oppose a jewish homeland in palestine so long as it did not lay claim to saudi territory on the eastern shore of the gulf of aqaba the relationship has always been close except for the time of king faisal who was conveniently shot in the face and killed by a relative
do you undergo pressure or threats in relation to the remarkable work you do if so how do you live it
i was forced to move my domicile from washington because the outgoing obama administration put pressure on some media organizations i did work for these included rt contributor agreement canceled and al jazeera america which is now defunct
the fbi entered my apartment in washington at least twice and ive had three visits by them at my new home in florida
i was informed of  personal threats in washington
i ignore all these pressures and continue to exercise the freedom of the press
are you optimistic or do you think that the satanist project of the oligarchy still has a nuisance capacity that can plunge the world into chaos
as with cockroaches which detest light the shadow figures of covert power cannot stand what is known as the disinfectant of sunshine light has always fought against darkness and will continue to do so

211,"as i have repeatedly shown in my articles i am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well you likely knew this already
you are also likely aware that i have done several articles on stretching most recently the relax into stretch technique that i state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility
but what about upper body flexibility most people dont focus on that and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance reduction of joint aches and pains and in some cases increased strength i have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch but in my opinion if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility that would have to be the seated twist stretch
how it works this stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees this stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids the obliques the neck and the pectorals
in addition to those visible muscles the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles  and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus medius and minimus as well
many athletes perform the twist stretch particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers judokas and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls
sounds like something you ought to learn doesnt it but how

as i have happily admitted in the past and will likely do so again paul wades outstanding convict conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises and i cannot advocate wades writing enough more specifically the twist stretch comes from convict conditioning   the first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups squats and the like i have already gone over these in detail in contrast the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the lsit and todays topic
while the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings that will be a topic for another time instead lets go into the steps of the twist stretch
all of the pictures here are taken directly from the book
the exercises the first twist stretch is the easy twist stretch sit down on the floor with your feet extended take one foot and put it inside the other leg resting that foot next to the opposite knee as shown
now twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised turn the right shoulder and vice versa keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn

then lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee while holding your body up with the other hand
you should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso
hold the stretch for  seconds for each side when this is comfortable for you move on
step  is the simple twist stretch which requires a little bit more flexibility place one foot over the other leg as shown above then take the foot that is not flat on the ground bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock

this foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth
now as before rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee and vice versa locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee and again supporting your body with the other hand hold for  seconds and move on
stretch  is where things become more difficult assume the position from stretch  but this time you will have to rotate the torso with much more force as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and i dont advise you try you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation

stretch  has the difficulty increase further get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long assume the stretching position and rotate the torso while holding said towel remove the supporting hand from the floor and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here wrapping the support hand around your back grab the other end of the towel this begins the stretch

each time you stretch you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands you will work your hands up and down the towel slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel eventually you will be able to clasp fingers and that is the final level of the twist stretch

this process will be slow and arduouscoach wade himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch i myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that i have about  more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch but i have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already
the towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel not just one actively use both to secure deeper stretches and you will notice progress
doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards and with practicing the more advanced variants you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds
or you could be one of millions of americans with bad backs and hips the choice is yours

among the many wikileaks emails that were dumped this summer it was clear that hillary clinton is not as popular as the media would have you believe in fact it became clear that she has no real support in a hacked email to the point where she was forced to pay young voters to stump online for her 
the gateway pundit reported  
shes the astroturfed candidate hillary is sooo unpopular that she has to pay off young voters to support her and show up at her rallies 
 biggest scoops from the dncleaks wikileak 
wikileaks released nearly  hacked emails it says are from the accounts of democratic national committee officials on friday 
the emails are devastating for hillary clinton according to at least one hacked email hillary clinton has no real support and must pay youth voters to defend her online she also pays millennials to show up at her rallies 
hillarys support is all a lie its all astroturfed everything this woman does is all a lie  even her rallies are fabricated

hillary clinton only has the backing of the media and rabid antiamerican liberals and even then it looks like shes having to pay them to actually do anything to support her in other words her candidacy is completely contrived

with donald trump set to take office in a couple of months a number of his lackeys have reportedly been in talks about possibly serving in the administration as of this writing there are three protrump pundits that might be in the trump administration 
eric bolling politico reported that bolling was seen at trump tower and was reportedly discussed for a position in the department of commerce what exactly that position that will be is not clear bolling told politico that he cant confirm anything 
geraldo rivera flatout asked bolling on the five if he had been offered a job and bolling gave a nonanswer  
bolling has been with fox news since  where he is the cohost of the five and hosts the weekend show cashin in  before then he had been an analyst on cnbc and a new york mercantile exchange nymex trader bolling has been an ardent supporter of trump from the getgo to the point where he resorted to some loony ideas  
laura ingraham according to cnn money  ingraham is being heavily considered for president trumps press secretary here is what ingraham has said on the matter 
i am honored to be considered for that job and other jobs so well see what happens ingraham said on fox news 
she cautioned i think people are getting a little far ahead of the narrative but she strongly suggested that some sort of trump administration post is in the works

like bolling ingraham who has been a nationally syndicated radio host since   has also been an early supporter of trump going as far as saying that nevertrump conservatives support partial birth abortion and her website lifezette attacked conservatives like ben shapiro for opposing the altright as usual shapiro punched back hard  
jeanine pirro pirro accompanied by rudy giuliani was seen headed inside trump tower which has led to speculation that she is being considered for a job in the trump administration according to page six  what that job would be is not known 
pirro also has been an early trump supporter and she has claimed to have known him for  years  pirros exhusband al pirro has been described as a man donald trump keeps on retainer as a realestate lawyer and trump once donated  to pirro when she ran for new york state attorney general

215,"fda to withdraw  generic adhd drugs after determining they have no therapeutic effects 
tuesday november   by vicki batts tags fda  adhd drugs  market withdrawal naturalnews adhd medications have been subject to public scrutiny for quite some time two years ago the fda said it had discovered problems with a generic version of a popular adhd drug known as concerta the generic produced by the pharmaceutical company mallinckrodt just wasnt up to snuff and now the fda seems to finally be making moves to pull this inferior product off the shelvesgeneric drugs are approved by the fda through their abbreviated new drug application anda process in the anda process the federal agency is primarily focused on data that shows the generic drug is a bioequivalent for the reference listed drug or what many people refer to as the brand name drugthe term bioequivalent means that there is no substantial differences in bioavailability between a generic drug and the brand name product specifically it suggests that the extent and rate of absorption of two drug equivalents over the same period of time at the same dose and under the same conditions should exhibit similar results as the fda explains on their website the generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patients bloodstream in the same amount of time as the pioneer drugunsurprisingly discrepancies in actual equivalence are often discovered after a generic has been approvedmallinckrodts concerta generic is not the only brand name knockoff under fire kremers urban pharmaceuticals a subsidiary of the lannett company also manufactures a generic form of the medication that the fdas center for drug evaluation and research cder has deemed insufficientas reported by the regulatory affairs professionals society cder tracked the issues from december  through june  ran a reanalysis of bioequivalence data and determined that the mallinckrodt product may deliver methylphenidate into the body at a slower rate than concerta during the time period of  to  hours postdosing following the cders findings mallinckrodt filed a lawsuit which was thrown out by a maryland federal judge the pharmaceutical company has since declined to voluntarily withdraw their product from the marketplace and according to the fda the drug manufacturer has yet to submit any new data or information that confirms the bioequivalence of their product to concertasimilarly the cder concluded in june of  that the data on the kremers product is insufficient to determine whether or not their generic product is therapeutically equivalent to concerta in november that year the fda announced that their product was not sufficiently equivalent to the name brandboth manufacturers may submit a request for a hearing to the fda within the next month so they can attempt to show why approval for their drugs shouldnt be withdrawnof course the fdas concerns about the apparent lack of efficacy seen in these generic drugs is rather ironic given the magnitude of other concerns surrounding these drugs in  a cbs news report revealed that  people died and  more suffered serious cardiovascular problems following the use of adhd medication in a period of just four yearsthat may not seem like a lot but is important to recall that the fda adverse event reporting system faers which is used to track such events is a voluntary system only drug manufacturers are required to report adverse events  if they know about them doctors patients and family members are under no such obligation psqh reports that drug safety experts estimate that only about  percent of all adverse events will even be reported  who is to say how many people have been harmed by adhd medications and other drugs and dont know it or havent reported itthe faers website itself states that because of its own limitations faers data cannot be used to calculate the incidence of an adverse event or medication error in the us population and yet in spite of this very statement the fda itself used this information to form a safety reportover the years several adhd medications like adderall xr have been linked to sudden death  cardiovascular problems and psychosis according to consumer reports  the longterm safety of these drugs has not been evaluated or studied sufficiently and there is evidence to suggest that the benefit of such drugs wears off after about two years many kids take adhd medication for quite a bit longer than thatin spite of all of this the fda has yet to pull these drugs from the shelves and is instead concerned with drugs that arent strong enough medications that dont work obviously dont belong in the marketplace however drugs that are killing children dont belong there either sources"

217,"china airport security robot gives electroshocks  
activist post 
while debate surrounds the threat of autonomous killer robots the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce 
the industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown as you can see in the graphic below  sales surged  over a previous record year to reach almost  million units 
there are many factors driving this growth which you can read about here but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the us and china with china leading the way 
the nature of robotics is also changing as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses one key area of course is security robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons  care facilities  and schools in various locations around the world 
one us robot company gamma  robotics has designed several models for mass production their latest  ramsee  can be seen in the video below a true mass rollout of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the  million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol 
ramsee advertises the following capabilities is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision provides realtime data intruders motion heat fire smoke gases  more is a humanmachine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier 
significantly gamma  robotics has partnered with hexagon safety  infrastructure the global leader in public safety and security solutions 
however ramsee is missing one thing weapons for that we have to travel to china where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle 
in late  i covered an announcement from chinas xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of  weaponized antiterrorism robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol 
the toysized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield said the report following their unveiling at the  world robot conference in beijing 
the first model is known as a reconnaissance robot which scouts for poisonous gases dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to baseif this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger the second robot model  a small explosive ordnance disposal eod machine  would be sent in to diffuse it 
but with other more complicated threats an attacker robot would start its mission armed with minorcaliber weapons recoilless rifles and grenade launchers 
with a sighting telescope a trigger and a safe installed the attacker can hit its target from a long distance xinhua said 
the local police force in beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots  which are priced at  million yuan  for the set by manufacturers hit robot group who are based in the northern city of harbin 
apart from antiterror operations they can also be applied in fire fighting public security forestry and agriculture the companys sales manager chen deqiang said according to xinhua 
if we have learned anything about antiterrorism efforts authorities consider frontline deployment to be areas of public travel we were given the tsa based on such notions and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports and soontobe at other public transportation if authorities have their way 
china has gone to the next level with a robot tsa of sorts called anbot that is equipped with what is essentially a taserlike device that is being fittingly compared to a cattleprod 
image credit 
it was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression for now its first job is to patrol chinas shenzhen airport 
most alarming however is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet 
the back end of this intelligent security robot is l inked to chinas tianhe supercomputer  where it has access to cloud services  anbot conducts patrols recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition 
these cloud services give the robots petascale processing power  well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot the supercomputer connection is there to enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and humanmachine interface of these devices said the uschina economic and security review in a report released tuesday that examines chinas autonomous systems development efforts  emphasis added 
 source  
this link to cloud services is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the wikipedia for robots  essentially an internet cloud brain through robottorobot information sharing they can speed up their learning process  autonomously examples have included robots that can learn to cook and robots that can learn the tasks involved in caregiving however when applied to policing things become much more ethically troubling 
people were outraged in the us for example when a robot in dallas was used to deliver a pound of c explosive to a us citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution at least in that case a human made the decision but it is being viewed as a tiptoe along the path to the widespread use of killer robots much as we have seen with the use of drones discussion was once limited to overseas  egregious enough  but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones 
as john vibes wrote  it might be inevitable 
the taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun according to a recent report by the wall street journal 
not only will the drones be equipped with tasers but there is also talk of them being autonomous meaning that an actual human wont necessarily be needed to fly the drone 
this is actually already being done in india  the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with nonlethal weapons and just this week british tabloid the sun  had a feature entitled vladimir putins russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies deputy pm dmitry rogozin admits given the available facts this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational 
clearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police but is that the trend we are actually seeing or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industriallevel suppression and killing

218,"foreign policy scotlands secretary of state david mundell photo by afp 
scottish secretary of state david mundell has warned about the consequences of the uks withdrawal from the european union eu saying brexit would cut access to the single market 
mundell told members of the scottish parliament on thursday that neither scotland nor any other part of the uk was going to get a special deal during the negotiations with the eu 
so there are very specific issues to specific industries but there wont be special deals and its absolutely wrong to characterize a suggestion that certain areas of the country will get a special deal and scotland will not he said 
i accept on one level if we are leaving the eu then essentially we are leaving the single market but access to the single market can i think continue in a way that doesnt involve tariffs or barriers the secretary continued 
british and scottish officials have long been engaged in a war of words over the brexit process with scotland asking for an equal role in the negotiations 
during an eu referendum on june  scotland voted  percent to  percent to remain in the member bloc but britons voted to leave  percent to  percent 
british prime minister theresa may has made it clear that she will complete the brexit process by  and that scotland holds no veto over it 
scotland in response has threatened to secede from the uk in order to preserve its eu membership which in turn guarantees the nations access to the eu single market 
last year scotlands first attempt for independence from the uk was blocked by voters in a referendum 
mundell told msps that the possibility of a second referendum was already harming scottish businesses even more than brexit 
it is already evident because i understand that the surveyors organization have said there is a drop off in the take up of commercial property in scotland he said 
experts warn that in case of a hard brexit the uk may lose its preferential access to the eus single market and suffer from soured relations with other eu members loading"

220,"by rmuse    am the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
for almost all secular humanists organized religion is nothing more than an easy means of controlling people through fear and intimidation throughout recorded history the catholic church has been responsible for all manner of devious machinations to control not just its adherents but any humans it comes in contact with that lust to control human beings has continued unabated into the st century and in america like the rest of the earth the catholics number one focus has been on controlling women apparently the catholic church in massachusetts wants to expand its control over the population 
on friday the boston globe reported that the archdiocese of boston dropped about a million dollars in a lastditch effort to exert church control over massachusetts law and citizens to stop marijuana from being legalized for recreational use other reports reveal that the taxexempt political spending is meant to help defeat a massachusetts ballot measure question   question  simply legalizes cannabis for recreational use for people over  and creates a commission to regulate marijuana in the state of massachusetts question  contains no references to the catholic or any other church and makes no claim of trying to  impact ministries  
a spokesman for the boston archdiocese terrence donilon made a truly pathetic attempt at justifying the catholic churchs political donation to the campaign against massachusetts version of legalized recreational marijuana saying  
 it reflects the fact that the archdiocese holds the matter among its highest priorities its a recognition that if passed the law would have significantly detrimental impacts on our parishes our ministries  
seriously that has to be one of the most monumental piles of bovine excrement of a reason to use taxfree congregants donations to interfere in an election ever offered nowhere in massachusetts or any states decriminalization statutes is any church mentioned much less affected by the outcome of an election catholic priests will still be free to sexually abuse little boys if adults can legally purchase and consume cannabis and despite residents having a toke in the privacy of their homes the church will still frighten its members into increasing their tithes and the usccb will still attempt to control and dominate all american women no reefer decriminalization will impact the catholic ministry but it will drastically reduce the number of people being arrested and imprisoned for marijuana possession free up law enforcement to pursue nasty pedophile priests and relieve americas overburdened judicial system 
now the catholics claim that people using cannabis legally whether they inhale or eat it will have  significantly detrimental impacts on their ministries  that is an odd assertion on yet another point surely part of catholic ministries is teaching according to their gods word in the christian bible it is nearly certain that every catholic priest on the planet including those in massachusetts are aware of gods word in genesis where in chapter  verse  the catholics  almighty god  said 
 out of the ground the lord god caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food  and he continues in verses    then the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to cultivate it and keep it the lord god commanded the man saying from any tree of the garden you may eat freely but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat for in the day that you eat from it you will surely die  
although there is recorded evidence that cannabis was first discovered to be used for its medicinal qualities  years ago  there is no record of reefer ever being confused with  the tree of the knowledge of good and evil  weed is not and will not affect the catholic ministries if it is decriminalized today any more than it has over the past twothousand years the catholic church has existed and cannabis was either unknown to the clergy or illegal 
in a reaction to the news the archdiocese was interfering with politics with taxexempt money an advocate and spokesman for the yes on question  jim borghesani said  
 the archdiocese has come up with a position that frankly we think is based on unfounded assumptions and junk science what i think the archdiocese is missing is the terrible harm that marijuana prohibition has done to people of color to people who have chosen a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol and have had their lives ruined because theyve been arrested  
one wonders if part of the boston archdioceses ministry entails increasing the number of americans mainly americans of color sent to prison for possessing or using a plant that  god caused to grow  and was  pleasing to the sight and good to eat  obviously that is the case and according to a new set of data keeping marijuana illegal means keeping americans arrested for drug possession at a rate of every  seconds of every day of the year 
why is the catholic church so interested in perpetuating the failed war on drugs in general and the criminalization of marijuana in particular as noted by michael stone over at patheos what the massachusetts catholics and mormons are actually helping to sustain is  in reality a war on poor people and people of color  mr stone really nails it when he said that by spending taxexempt donations on a political agenda to  defend the unjust prohibition on marijuana the catholic church is guilty of perpetuating the failed war on drugs and the new jim crow  
the archdiocese is also guilty of hypocrisy besides implicit racism because any religious organization that condones and even promotes the use of alcohol while using taxexempt donations to maintain the ridiculous prohibition on cannabis is  morally indefensible  mormons are also busy instructing lds members to vote against all state initiatives that seek to decriminalize and regulate recreational marijuana use as if it has any affect whatsoever on either their private mormon lives or their lds ministry but they allegedly dont condone or enjoy alcohol so they just have control issues and are not blatant hypocrites at least where cannabis decriminalization is concerned 
the massachusetts catholics may not be violating the law by  acting as an antimarijuana super pac  but they are using taxexempt member donations to politically influence an election and control other americans lives the church is all about wielding ultimate control over all facets of american society however if the church is so flush with money why not use that money to compensate the thousands of victims of the churchs pedophile priests or dog forbid use that taxexempt donors money to help the people of massachusetts in need 
the catholic church is guilty of using fear and intimidation to control its own adherents and that is down to frightened people needing a  daddy figure in the church to tell them what is right what is wrong and how to stay out of the proverbial hell that is all well and good for people that willingly cry out for a controlling organization speaking for a deity but for people that are not  in the church  it is an affront to use donated taxexempt money to impact read control their private lives the only good news out of this abominable story is that it looks like question  will pass with relative ease informing that the archdiocese wasted about a million dollars of its congregations hardearned money 
this is yet another example of why all churches should be taxed like every other business and american citizen except donald trump it is  morally obnoxious  that the archdiocese is using the congregations donations for political purposes to influence an election and yet another sign that there is no area the church considers as out of bounds in attempting to control every aspect of society with taxexempt funds wrung out of hardworking americans many of whom use recreational cannabis

231,"by hrafnkell haraldsson on sat oct th  at  am if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect   
president barack obama did not have to do anything wrong for republicans to want to throw him in jail or to impeach him hillary clinton doesnt have to have done anything wrong either apparently for congress to appoint a special prosecutor to take her down once elected  because a bunch of emails had nothing to do with her  
at least that and completely ignoring the facts was the theme on fox news last night though to be fair other mainstream media outlets werent much better yesterday 
megyn kelly fresh from a stint of pretending to be a feminist in a faceoff with newt gingrich suggested to chairman of the house judiciary committee bob goodlatte rwv that given the fbi revelations of a complete lack of evidence that hillary clinton has done anything wrong what needs to happen is a special prosecutor 
megyn kelly  let me ask you this if she gets elected on november th this isnt going away so what needs to happen a special prosecutor she cant investigate herself as the presidentelect bob goodlatte  well first of all we have said from the outset that the house judiciary committee would follow the truth wherever it leads and we have done that throughout the summer asking a number of questions about how this investigation by the fbi was being conducted we will continue to do that we dont know whats going to happen now we dont know whats going to happen after the election so its pure speculation what will happen afterwards a special prosecutor remember is appointed by the attorney general of the united states so you have to decide whether thats going to be a fairer investigation than the one being conducted by the fbi under the direction of director comey right now and the judiciary committee will certainly stay engaged in this and continue our investigation 
democracy is a fragile thing it is to goodlattes credit that he declined the call to draw up articles of impeachment in  and that he cautioned megyn kelly that a special prosecutor is appointed not by the house but by the attorney general however the gopled house has been far too engaged already in undermining our democracy 
what holds this country together is an idea and an agreement among all parties that it works republicans have decided it only works if theyre in charge and this has brought us to the point where we threaten to jail our adversaries appoint special prosecutors if they win or vote to impeach them outright as trumps pet snake at cnn jeffrey lord called for last night  
two points anderson one with  days left this makes donald trumps argument exactly to the point here you sum up the argument in terms of her judgment her paranoia and all of the rest the second thing anderson is and this is the really disturbing thing lets just say for the sake of the argument she wins the election this isnt going to stop there will be a move to impeach her the moment her hand comes down from that bible this is going to go on and on and on and on and frankly i mean thats something the american people need to consider now 
it is not difficult to see where this will lead hillary clinton has committed no crimes far from being a miscarriage of justice though it is that as well this is a miscarriage of reason and sanity 
this sort of talk is just further evidence that donald trump comes from the same vile brew as paul ryan and mitch mcconnell and the rest of the party during the mccarthy era the house took it upon itself to be both judge and jury last night it was fox news egging the house on for more of the same 
this sort of talk is deplorable it is reprehensible and it is dangerous  and strikes at the very heart of our democracy"

233,"i had a garage sale today and a number of people came and bought stuff most of them left here are the ones who are still sticking around  the guy who bought my lamp 
i expected the guy who bought my lamp to leave after he bought my lamp but he did not leave he sat down on my lawn and started reading the newspaper i went up to him and asked him if he needed help with anything and he said nope been saving my appetite all day i didnt really know what that meant but someone had a question about my foosball table at that moment so i didnt have time to get clarification on that  the couple who didnt buy anything but spent a lot of time browsing my box of national geographic sand then got in their car and took a nap 
these people seemed really into my national geographic s so i was pretty surprised when they decided not to buy them i was also surprised when instead of leaving they just got in their car and started napping theyre still asleep and theres a little postit on their window that says wake us up when its ready  the old woman who bought my vacuum 
when the old lady who bought my vacuum offered to pay for my vacuum by vacuuming my house i thought it was a little odd but also kind of nice my place is a little dusty these days and definitely could use a good vacuuming so i said yes i wish that she had left after she finished vacuuming my house she is now in the kitchen and has been vacuuming the same corner for the last  minutes plus she keeps chiming in on how to make the pasta sauce i have to admit she did a pretty good job cleaning my house though i dont know how to ask her to leave without sounding rude  the lady who bought a plate a fork and a knife 
i assumed this woman bought these items for her own home but its been three hours and she is just standing by the front door sneaking peeks at the kitchen through the window this is becoming stressful  the kid who bought my toaster even though i told him it was broken and then handed me a list of his allergies 
when this kid asked me how much i wanted for the toaster i was upfront about the fact that it was broken but that didnt matter to him he bought the thing for  cents and then handed me a list of allergies he had now he is sitting out on the lawn along with the guy who bought my lamp and i think theyre working on a crossword puzzle together i really dont think i have enough ingredients to make food for all these people also there are a lot of allergies on this list  the older gentleman who brought a raw steak to my garage sale and then bought a coatrack 
i dont know why the old man who bought the coatrack brought a raw steak to my garage sale after he purchased the coatrack he placed the raw steak in a dish to marinate then put it in my garage fridge i asked him what he was doing and he said gotta marinate this bad boy for dos horas compadre buon appetito he is still here and his steak is still marinating overall id say the garage sale itself was a success because i made about  but it ended hours ago and all these people have not left yet and i dont know what to do"

former defense minister of canada paul hellyer has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the state canada on the ceta treaty ceta stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet paul hellyer called the treaty therefore comprehensive trade and takeover agreement with this convention which comes out of the hat of the international bankers  families will obtain control over almost the entire world constitutions of member countries will no longer apply only the will of the  families the elite will apply 
the lawsuit was officially filed on october  of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of parliament through an act of parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign ceta and  or perform without having this treaty first by the parliament through official channels  the solid majority of the ceta articles and their impact encroach on exclusive provincial spheres or forumprotected by the division of powers under the constitution act  
most of the ceta provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the canadian constitutional law  the ceta gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected judiciary in canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in canada without any judicial oversight or jurisdiction of the canadian courts over the disputes and 
ceta removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the canadian legal system and various articles of the ceta violate constitutional enshrined rights in the charter of rights and freedoms  and overrides charter guarantees that ground canadas ability to mount public programs on health education social services and public utilitiesincluding the elimination of subsidies monopolies and state enterprises for public welfare in short the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about those of the canadian constitution and canadian citizens 
various provisions of ceta violated constitutional builtrights enshrined in the document charter of rights and freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health education social services and public funds including the termination of subsidies  monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest in short the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the canadian constitution and its inhabitants 
but this is not all paul hellyer which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to canadians and the rest of the world his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world the international bankers international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only  families 
paul hellyer remembers the canada which was separate from the bankers yet not so long ago until  the canadian government expressed its money itself there was no such thing as inflation poverty and debt canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that europe was liberated from the germans at that time life was good cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do from one day to the issued money creation in  the central banks and money was no longer free within a few years canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes paul hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend this affects every canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education health housing etc can be paid without causing debts paul hellyer does the same as foundation for our money aims but in a turbo version he lets no grass grow does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years paul hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat 
now the video of paul hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this 
dear readers this could be the big break this information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers the same applies we can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people the power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it we want a better and fairer world then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for 
privatized money is the reason for all wars privatized money is the cause of poverty oppression exploitation neglect of our elderly and less fortunate privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet now is the chance to get out from under the yoke to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over  years with one goal to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer 
the earth is not a handful of bankers and politicians the earth belongs to everyone"

president barack obama has been campaigning hard for the woman who is supposedly going to extend his legacy four more years the only problem with stumping for hillary clinton however is shes not exactly a candidate easy to get too enthused about"
237,link hello again ats though we are two weeks out from election day as i sit to write these words  i find myself already looking beyond tuesday november the eighth and at some of the things that i think will happen between now and  as well as what i think the landscape will look like in the year leading up to that years election it wont be a popular opinion here on ats i am sure but as of today i feel confident in saying that short of some unprecedented and wholly unforseeable revelation or event  this years election is very likely a done deal hillary clinton will almost certainly be the next president of the united states with just two weeks remaining before election day  as of this writing  the metaanalysis of polls shows clinton possessing nearly an insurmountable lead while it is true that trump enjoys a very passionate and enthusiastic base he has done little to successfully expand that base the potential for him to find a means of connecting with undecided and uncommitted voters is minimal and shrinks with each passing day having come to this view i find myself free to look beyond the coming weeks and to try and get a handle on what a post  world will look like frankly gazing into my allegorical crystal ball i see dark and threatening clouds gathering on our horizon clouds that could very well bring a storm of epic proportions our way election night blues the night of tuesday november the eighth could well be historic  in the worst of ways this election cycle has broken several taboos and lowered the bar of political discourse in unprecedented ways it has been a season of highly divisive hyperbole and rhetoric that has builtup a great deal of social tension we currently sit atop a very very dry powder keg of anger that is seething and highly volatile passions will be flaring among many as we watch the election results stream in on our televisions computers and phones many of those watching will be deeply deeply emotionally invested in the outcome of this race in this climactic moment we as a nation will be perilously close to critical mass one spark away from potential disaster four years ago a man with some degree of fame was emotionally invested in that years election and he took to social media twitter to vent his reactions in a paroxysmal spasm of emotion that minor celebrity was one donald j trump source imagine for a moment what could happen if history repeats itself and this same man goes on a similar rant this election night imagine the violence such a display could potentially trigger then stop imagining and take a deep breath such a reaction is not just possible  given the evidence it is more than likely the probable outcome trump is currently heavily invested in telling his followers that the election is rigged that they have no voice and that he is the only one who can save them this is a very very dangerous and unstable bit of social chemistry most trump supporters obviously will not lash out in violence if their candidate loses the race  even if they personally feel that the outcome of the election was not legitimate however some trump supporters those in the extremes of what the media is currently calling the alt right very well could take to the streets in rage given some of the fringe support that trump enjoys i would honestly be surprised if such things were not already being planned by a handful of those on the fringe the rhetoric of revolution has been abused of late  and there are always the few who take such statements far too literally across the line blunty put  if election night comes and trump loses  and if he takes to twitter as he did four years ago  it could well result in a very long and bloody night a catastrophic night that we will look back upon with shame a night that could well poison our nation for years to come much ado about trump tv many pundits and wonks have mused over the fact that it truly does appear that trump has been laying the groundwork for a future media operation presumably a news network or service of some kind i count myself among those who have been suggesting so for a fairly long time however where i differ is that i dont see it as being quite so cut and dry any longer while i do think that trumps original thoughts  or more the thoughts of those who influence trump  was to create a new media conservative news venue i think that its now grown into something more i think that trump tv  or whatever they end up calling it  trump tv is too generic theres no inherent propaganda value in the name i think something more like trumps maga network is probably more on point  will be used as a device to begin a new political party more accurately to succeed where others have previously failed  im looking at you sarah palin and glenn beck  by congealing the various patriot tea party and fringe right wing groups into one collective and singular entity  a party firmly rooted in extreme nationalism with enough religion and conservatism thrown in to gain wider appeal my prediction is that donald trump will remain the focal point and figurehead of this coming movement  using this new network much as he currently utilizes his twitter feed a platform for him to vent his late night frustrations angers and insecurities his name will be predominantly used in the branding and messaging and trump will be the face of it all the most frequent speaker and guest imagine if the apprentice had been a  live streaming show  and trump had the power to walk in at any moment to say whatever happened to be on his mind that is how i see trump tv however i dont see trump being the driving force behind the actual message trump is a brand after all he has made his place in this world by putting his name on buildings he didnt build shows that he didnt create and ideas he didnt originate trump works as a spokesperson  the guy who says im not only the president of but im also a member the real people behind the curtain will be the mercers  robert and rebekah  steve bannon and to a lesser degree roger ailes as for on camera talents i think the current obvious potential faces of this new media enterprise will be hannity oreilly and lahren  though im honestly not personally sure if oreilly will make the jump money is money after all and big daddy bill is sitting pretty comfortably atop the fox news heap as his career winds down regardless however of who wins the backstage power war  other than the mercers who are a lock  and the on camera positions the network itself will be the propaganda arm of the extreme right wing and i think it very well could end up pulling the national discourse much further to the right in the coming  years particularly with the subjects of national isolationism and national identity politics

the following excerpt is adapted from mendenhalls review of deirdre mccloskeys book bourgeois equality the original review which appeared in the quarterly journal of austrian economics is available here 
if its true that wayne booth inspired deirdre mccloskeys interest in the study of rhetoric then its also true  happily in my view  that mccloskey has refused to mimic booths programmatic formulaic methods and boorish insistence on prosaic succinctness bourgeois equality is mccloskeys third volume in a monumental trilogy that began with the bourgeois virtues  and bourgeois dignity  each published by the university of chicago press this latest volume is a big book alike in kind but not in theme to jacques barzuns from dawn to decadence  camille paglias sexual personae  or herald bermans law and revolution  and law and revolution ii  its meandering and personal blending scholarship with an essayistic style that recalls montaigne or emerson 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
mccloskeys elastic arguments are shaped by informal narrative and enlivened by her plain and playful voice at times humorous rambling and deliberately erratic she gives the distinct impression that shes simply telling a story one that happens to validate a thesis shes having fun imagine phillip lopate articulating economic history mccloskey is in this regard a latterday edward gibbon adopting a mode and persona thats currently unfashionable among mainstream historians except that shes more lighthearted than gibbon and unashamedly optimistic 
writing with an air of confidence mccloskey submits contra thomas piketty that ideas and ideology  not capital accumulation or material resources  have caused widespread economic development since  worldwide material wealth has increased and proliferated the quality of life in poor countries has risen  even if it remains unequal to that of more prosperous countries and the typical human being now enjoys access to the food goods services medicine and healthcare that in earlier centuries were available to only a select few in the richest parts of the globe the transition from poverty to wealth was occasioned by shifting rhetoric that reflected an emerging ethical consensus the rhetoricalethical change involved peoples attitudes toward other humans p xxiii namely the recognition of shared experience and sympathy as adam smith stated in the theory of moral sentiments attributing human progress to ideas enables mccloskey to advocate the norms and principles that facilitated economic growth and social improvement eg class mobility and fluidity while generating extensive prosperity thus her project is at once scholarly and tendentious a study of the conditions and principles that in turn she promotes 
she argues that commercialism flourished in the eighteenth century under the influence of ideas  such as human equality of liberty in law and of dignity and esteem p xxix  that were packaged in memorable rhetoric and aesthetics not matter mainly but ideas caused the great enrichment p  in other words the original and sustaining causes of the modern world  were ethical not material and they included the new and liberal economic idea of liberty for ordinary people and the new and democratic social idea of dignity for them p xxxi this thesis about liberty and dignity is clear and unmistakable if only because it is repetitive mccloskey has a habit of reminding readersin case you missed her point the first second or fiftyseventh time aroundthat the causes of the industrial revolution and the great enrichment were ideas not narrowly economic or political or legal changes p  she maintains to this end that the scottish enlightenment succeeded in combining the concepts of liberty and dignity into a desirable form of equalitynot equality of outcomes of course but of opportunity and treatment under the law and the scottish model to her mind stands in contradistinction to the french example of centralized topdown codification command planning and design 
a perennial villain lurks in the pages of her history the clerisy which is an appendage of the bourgeoisie p  and often dubbed the elite in regular parlance mccloskey calls the clerisy the sons of bourgeois fathers p xvii and neoaristocratic p  the clerisy includes those artists intellectuals journalists professionals and bureaucrats who resent the commercial and bettering bourgeoisie p xvi the clerisy seeks in different ways at different times to extinguish unfettered competition with exclusive illiberal irrevocable grants and privileges that are odious to free society and offensive to the rights of average consumers early on says mccloskey referring to the period in europe after the revolutionary year  the clerisy began to declare that ordinary people are misled in trading and so require expert protection and supervision p  the clerisy since then has been characterized by paternalism and a sense of superiority 
because the clerisy is shapeshifting assuming various forms from time to time and place to place its a tough concept to pin down the word clerisy does not appear in the books index to permit further scrutiny by contrast mccloskeys general arguments are easy to follow because the book is separated into parts with questions as their titles subparts consisting of onesentence headings answer those questions 
in a massive tour de force such as this readers are bound to take issue with certain interpretive claims historians will find mccloskeys summaries to be too breezy even libertarians will accuse her of overlooking manifest wrongs that occurred during the periods she surveys my complaints are few but severe for instance mccloskey is i believe either careless or mistaken to announce that during the nineteenth and early twentieth century under the influence of a version of science in a territory thats never specifically identified the right seized upon social darwinism and eugenics to devalue the liberty and dignity of ordinary people and to elevate the nations mission above the mere individual person recommending for example colonialism and compulsory sterilization and the cleansing power of war p xviii 
lets hope that its innocent negligence rather than willful distortion that underlies this odd unqualified categorical assertion adam cohens imbeciles  and thomas c leonards illiberal reformers  describe how in the united states social darwinism and eugenics were adopted primarily though not exclusively by the left not the right these recent books come on the heels of several scholarly treatments of this subject thomas m shapiros population control politics  philip r reillys the surgical solution  joel braslows mental ills and bodily cures  wendy klines building a better race  stefan kuhls the nazi connection  nancy ordovers american eugenics  christine rosens preaching eugenics  christina cogdells eugenic design  gregory michael dorrs segregations science  paul a lombardos edition a century of eugenics in america  and alexander minna sterns eugenic nation  these represent only a small sampling 
is mccloskey unware of these texts probably not she reviewed leonards book for reason although she did so after her own book reached press at any rate would she have us believe that emma goldman george bernard shaw eugene debs marie stopes margaret sanger john maynard keynes lester ward and w e b du bois were eugenicist agitators for the political right if so she should supply her definition of right since it would go against commonly accepted meanings on the matter of colonialism and war selfidentified members of the old right such as albert jay nock john flynn and senator robert taft advocated precisely the opposite of what mccloskey characterizes as right these men opposed among other things military interventionism and adventurism the trouble is that mccloskeys muddying of the signifiers left and right comes so early in the bookin the exordium that readers may lose trust in her question her credibility and begin to suspect the labels and arguments in her later chapters 
other undefined terms only make matters worse ensuring that mccloskey will alienate many academics who as a class are already inclined to reject her libertarian premises she throws around the term romanticism as if its referent were eminently clear and uncontested a conservative and romantic vision p xviii science fiction and horror fiction are  offshoots of romanticism p  jane austen is not a romantic novelist  because she does not take art as a model for life and does not elevate the artist to a lonely pinnacle of heroism or worship of the middle ages or adopt any of the other antibourgeois themes of novalis franz brentano sir walter scott and later romantics p  romanticism around  revived talk of hope and faith and a love for art or nature or the revolution as a necessary transcendent in peoples lives p  romantic candor p  the late eighteenthcentury romantic literary critics in england had no idea what john milton was on about sic because they had set aside the rigorously calvinist theology that structured his poetry p  the nationalist tradition of romantic writing of history p  romantic  hostilities to  democratic rhetoric p  in the eighteenth century  the idea of autonomy triumphed at any rate among the progressive clerisy and then became a leading romantic idea á la victor hugo p  and the romantic conservative thomas carlyle p  
to allege that the clerisy was thrilled by the romantic radicalism of books like mein kampf or what is to be done p xviii is also recklessly to associate the philosophies of say keats or coleridge or wordsworth with the exterminatory fantasies of hitler and lenin mccloskey might have guarded against this misleading conflation by distinguishing german idealism or contextualizing hegel or by being more vigilant with diction and definition her loose language will leave some experts i do not profess to be one scratching or shaking their heads and more problematic some nonexperts with misconceptions and misplaced targets of enmity one imagines the overeager and wellmeaning undergraduate having read bourgeois equality setting out to demonize william blake or destroy the reputation of percy shelly about whom paul cantor has written judiciously wouldnt originality imagination creativity and individualismwidely accepted markers of romanticismappeal to mccloskey yet her unconditionally derogatory treatment of romanticismwhich she portrays as a fixed monolithic selfevident thingundermines aspects of that fluctuating movement period style culture and attitude that are or seem to be consistent with her weltanschauung 
but i protest too much these complaints should not diminish what mccloskey has accomplished would that we had more grand studies that mapped ideas and traced influences across cultures communities and eras mccloskey takes the long view as we all should her focus on rhetoric is crucial to the future of liberty if given the technological advances we have made the work we do will be more and more about decisions and persuading others to agree changing minds and less and less about implementation by hand p  equally significant is her embrace of humanomicsdefined as the story of a complete human being with her ethics and language and upbringing p xxwhich materializes in casual references to henrik ibsens plays challenges to the depiction of john milton as a lonely poet in a garret writing merely to the starry heavens p  analyses of jane austens novels and portrayals of elizabethan england her historical and narrative arc enables us to contextualize our own moment with all of its troubles and possibilities 
best of all her book is inspiring and exhilarating and brimming with rousing imperatives and moving calls to action let us then she says at one point not reject the blessings of economic growth on account of planning or pessimism the busybody if wellintentioned rationalism of some voices of the french enlightenment or the adolescent if charming doubts of some voices of the german romantic movement fashionable though both attitudes have long been among the clerisy as rational optimists let us celebrate the great enrichment and the rhetorical changes in freer societies that caused it p  at another point she encourages her audience to guard against both cynicism and utopianism p  and elsewhere to heed tradetested cooperation competition and conservation in the right mix p  these little nudges lend her credibility insofar as they reveal her true colors as it were and demonstrate that she is not attemptingas is the academic wontto hide her prejudices and conceal her beliefs behind pretended objectivities 
poverty is relative and hence permanent and ineradicable despite mccloskeys claim that we can end poverty p  if tomorrow we woke up and the wealth of each living person were magically to multiply twentyfoldeven fiftyfoldthere would still be people at the bottom the quality of life at the bottom however would be vastly improved the current manifestation of global poverty shows how far we as a species have advanced in the last few centuries mccloskey is right we should pursue the ideas that accelerated and achieved human flourishing that demonstrably brought people out of distress and destitution hard sciences and mathematical models are insufficient in themselves to convey the magnitude and splendor of these ideas and their accomplishments hence we should welcome and produce more books like mccloskeys that undertake a rhetoricalethical revaluation to both examine and celebrate a society of open inquiry one which not only depends on rhetoric in its politics and in its science and in its economy but which also yields intellectual creativity and political freedom p  in mccloskeys approach economics and the humanities are not mutually exclusive rather they are mutually illuminating and in fact indispensably and inextricably tied an economics that forsakes the dignity of the human person and his capacity for creativity and aesthetics does so at its own peril and to its own disgrace all economics is at its core humanomics we could do without the latter term if we understood the former newsletter sign up get the latest breaking news  specials from alex jones and the infowars crew related articles"

it is a cruel reality of american electoral politics that the losers of presidential campaigns get banished from national discourse and that process has already begun for donald trump 
despite the fact that trump has been claiming that the presidential election is going to be rigged stolen or unfair his cries are beginning to fall on deaf ears the latest washington post tracking poll found that confidence that votes will be counted correctly grew by  points from  the number of respondents who believed that voter fraud occurs somewhat often has dropped from  and those expressing concerns that all votes will be counted accurately dropped from  to  even trump supporters are split  on whether or not votes will be counted accurately 
part of the shift is likely due to the effective job that president obama did in addressing these concerns but it is most likely that voters are treating trump like the candidate who is going to lose the election 
one of the best indicators of a presidential elections outcome as election day draws near is the question of who voters think will win 
hillary clinton is dominant on the question of who voters believe will win the election which is a hint of the way that people are voting 
the process of tuning out the losing candidate has a long history in the us two party system losing candidates who refuse to go away like sarah palin are viewed as annoying relics who refuse to acknowledge that their time is up 
trumps fifteen minutes of fame on the national stage appear to be coming to an end his words can still poison and damage our country at a cultural level which is why he still needs to be discussed but as far as changing minds and winning an election it looks voters are in the process of banishing trump from the political island"

243,"print fairfax county virginia voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot among others 
democratic party officials in fairfax county virginia are categorically denying that prodemocrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee or fcdc 
earlier this week jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters 
i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee giving me a stepbystep yesandno what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot 
in recent days at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots 
after the report was first published and shared on facebook by david jones fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained 
these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time commented anderson 
that triggered a quick backandforth between david jones and anderson 
i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope jones said 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots replied anderson 
then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters said jones who should i believe you or my lying eyes 
anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives 
i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe concluded anderson 
the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america anderson protested the premise of the story 
please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate 
he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy 
in a formal interview fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true 
its not possible said neilson who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats 
voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed 
the same day the ballot is mailed our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax county democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot said neilson noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax 
listen to the wndradio america interview with bruce neilson 
however he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself 
that material is mailed in a separate envelope labeled with our initials  fcdc  and our return address in fairfax virginia and would be received either the same day perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government neilson said 
its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes he said 
jones is standing by her story  percent as is her husband david says its a very clear memory 
jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot the green sample ballot the twosided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope which i signed david said 
the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit 
i can confirm this i live in herndon va fairfax county and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename 
get the hottest most important news stories on the internet  delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break take just  seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts 
another under the reddit handle nightingalenights said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week 
neilson said there is no way the county government which sends out the ballots could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot 
they dont have our materials he said our materials are printed for us by our printer and we have complete control over our materials in our office and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else 
its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future neilson said 
there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot 
i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that jones said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues 
neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true 
i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail neilson said 
he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight 
i am an election official on election day i serve in a nonpartisan capacity for our county election office nielson said i can assure you you have democrats and republicans working in the office you have plenty of oversight of the voting process and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot there is no way that happened 
the following are three images of the democratic party materials jena and david jones say they found stuffed inside the absentee ballot 
the following are two images from democrats who say the voters must be confused"

 have a really awesome theme the best halloween parties are the ones that have a great theme and stick to it unless thats just not a thing your friends would be into is it ghosts and ghouls or zombie apocalypse or maybe your party is the fourth one of the night for your friends and they dont want to spend money on multiple costumes in that case maybe a theme isnt the way to go just ask around and youll be good to go 
 fire up some spooky music nothing sets the mood like some classic monster mash however its entirely possible that your attendees would actually favor a playlist of pop hits to just generally hang out to no worries then just do whats best for you and everyone thats planning on coming and youll surely still have a great time right

 make sure to have a mix of really fun party games look were really generalizing here is this suggestion for everyone no only you know if your friends will be excited to bob for apples or whatever we cant make individual lists for every goddamn reader so surprise youre going to have to do a little work too and decide if this one is right for your gathering 
 prepare some festive candycorn cupcakes or if you hate candy corn or if your friend alicia has celiac or if you would rather make chocolate cupcakes or if your apartment has a weird gas smell or if you dont have the time or if your coworker is in charge of the food or if you think youd mess up the recipe really badly or if you made these last year and dont want to be typecast as a person who is always making candycorn cupcakes or for any of the other infinite disqualifying reasons do absolutely nothing nothing like a sweet treat to bring a halloween party to the next level 
 dont have the party if your friends dont like to party on halloween we shouldnt have to say this but you dont have to throw a party at all why did you even read this list if you know your crew hates halloween what the hell is wrong with you please close this tab power down your computer and throw it in the ocean thanks"

247,"the iraqi city of karbala where the holy shrine of the third shia imam imam hussein is located is swarming with millions of devoted muslims both shiites and sunnis for mourning rituals marking arbaeen known as the largest religious gathering in the world  shares
   
given the mainstream medias constant sensationalized reporting on terror and muslims in the western world the utter lack of coverage of arbaeens march on sunday and monday revealed the double standard that exists in reporting on peaceful muslims
monday marked the final day of the mourning for imam hussein who was martyred in a battle with the massive army of yazid after refusing allegiance to the tyrant caliph yazid the caliph of umayyad dynasty was promoting the same type of islam as isis and wahhabist preach today
millions of marchers participated in the annual arbaeen procession in karbala the marchers are said to come from over  countries and most of them have marched all the way to karbala from other iraqi cities like najaf and baghdad in a show of devotion each year sunni muslims and followers of other religious groups such as christians join the journey to mourn the martyrdom of imam hussein
arbaeen or mourning is a shia muslim tradition to mark the anniversary of seventhcentury social justice leader imam husain arbaeen is commemorated  days after ashura the martyrdom anniversary of imam hussein as and his companions in  ad however in light of isis terror attacks globally several people took the controversial step of turning their march political in order to denounce terror in all forms
tens of thousands of muslims have been killed and displaced by isiss declared caliphate an exponentially larger number than those killed in attacks in the west
more the walk of light  arbaeen pilgrimage rises a great resistance against radicalism messenger   muslims develop technology to promote religious unity against radicalism why muslims hold the biggest human gathering under the threat of isis in iraq the th days new campaign  communitybuilding and social solidarity the occasion has found additional significance in recent years as it has become a rallying cry for the campaign against isis terrorists who have frequently targeted the pilgrims
iraqi troops have been deployed to ensure security for the pilgrims the northern and western parts of iraq have been plagued by gruesome violence ever since isis terrorists began a campaign of terror in the country in june 
the terrorist campaign however has not dissuaded pilgrims from around the world from making the journey
it is noteworthy to mention the mainstream media blackout of the millions people marched gathering in war torn iraq battling the isis as a clear sign of biased reporting"

250,"with a supplemantry note by lasha darkmoon on the transhumanist depopulation agenda we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief the day of reckoning has arrived  vid rebel i never said i supported donald trump because i liked where he wanted us to go i did say i was interested in the anger of the bernie sanders and donald trump voters on election night a bbc reporter tried to explain how hillary lost that state which has a huge black vote and lots of technically advanced people from out of state in what americans call researchtriangle park obama went there in a last ditch effort to get out the vote he was popular there amongst the college students they had voted for him in  but not so much for hillary in  the bbc reporter told us the people who lived there said they were all bernie voters they had zero enthusiasm for hillary 
i previously quoted mike rivero who had said that if hillary clinton were running in november against godzilla the lizard would have his vote we have seen the hillary koolaid drinkers go crazy after donald won they all live in bubbles where it would have been career suicide to say you voted against hillarys pay for pay corruption 
i have seen a lot of domestic antitrump propaganda from the far right because donald is a zionist i agree with donald that we should stop funding isis and let vladimir putin take them down it was obama who armed isis and let a small band become an international menace overnight by allowing them to take mosul in  and refusing to let the usaf take them out on that highway from syria but i do disagree with donalds intention to confront iran for what resisting zionism 
but fortunately for iran what trump and americas rulers want will soon become irrelevant of course that is not good news for americans who blindly follow the people who think they own the government of the united states 
i have just now seen from europe sheer postelection idiocy some are claiming that donald trump is the puppet of the fourth reich and is backed by the same industrialists and money men that had elevated adolf hitler to the chancellorship in  
it is silly to think that the rockefellers and the rothschilds backed trump 
i do admit that america is run by a criminal elite i had written that catherine austin fitts said the us military and intelligence services had given donald a green light to dish out dirt on hillary these men were on the inside of the vile mechanism that runs america but even they thought hillary was one witch too far to go 
i have reported on the elite end game many times before their plan is far worse than just cloning hitler and making him president and commander in chief far worse 
the people who had owned the governments in the west until recently were the  families and their  minions that is according to david rothkopf the former ceo of kissinger associates and author of superclass 
fortunately for us the people of the us and europe are learning to resist 
i voted once in a presidential election where the democrat was a member of the trilateral commission headed by david rockefeller in north america and sir evelyn de rothschild in europe the republican was a member of the bilderberg society headed by sir evelyn de rothschild in europe and headed by david rockefeller in north america you never read that in our corporate media 
please do not call those people who run hollywood and our tv news nazis they are either jewish or work for jewish companiesthe direct ties of those who thought they were born to rule over us are more to banking than to industry they are not nazis    the transhumanist depopulation agenda ld  in a breakthrough interview on the transhumanist agenda and the  presidential election catherine austin fitts former us assistant housing secretary and publisher of the solari report spoke of the engineered rise of autism gmo proliferation the expansion of entrainment technology the rise of artificial intelligence and robotics and the dumbing down of american students with common core see here  these were all she argued part of an overarching conspiracy to promote a massive transhumanist depopulation agenda this would be achieved by an engineered economic armageddon leading to mass starvation food riots and race wars that would wipe billions of people off the face of the planet how soon this apocalyptic scenario is likely to unfold is anyones guess any moment now many doomsayers declare the coming of donald trump is regarded by many as an omen of the end days ld vid rebel continues 
catherine austin fitts said the bankers stole  trillion from us i think they stole a lot more 
the bankers gave themselves the right to charge us interest on money they created out of nothing in  when they founded the bank of england america copied the bank of england and the german central bank when they drafted the legislation for the federal reserve in  it became law in  just in time for america to create enough unpayable debt at interest to fund ww i 
the united states entered ww i because the elite did not want the allies to accept germanys offer to stop the fighting in  the elite wanted the war to last long enough to bankrupt britain and france to set up a jewish communist dictatorship in russia and to make palestine a british colony for the jews none of that benefited voters in europe or america and the bought and paid for media cannot understand why we despise both them and the  families that sent them 
we are now in a far worse condition than if hitlers clone were to become president on january   
the elite stole all of our pensions and savings they sold hundreds of trillions in bad bets otherwise known as credit default swaps just so they could pocket tens of trillions of dollars in premiums dont cry for them they made people like you ie taxpayers liable for the inevitable consequences for their actions just add another few hundred trillion dollars onto the pile of unpayable debts to be taken out of your pension fund your savings your bank account and your paycheck their malfeasance will become your obligation in the very near future at least that is what they are planning 
the bankers gave you a system in which you cannot have money unless you go into debt the federal reserve will not issue paper money until the treasury gives them a bond obligating us to pay them interest on money they created out of nothing you cannot have checking account money until someone takes out a loan and is willing to pay the bankers interest on money they created out of nothing 
if we had lincolns noninterest bearing greenbacks we would not have  trillion in national debt and be paying  billion a year in taxes to pay the resulting interest 
the recent sharp rise in the interest rate on  year treasury bonds means our financial system is near collapse 
a depression is a period in time when unpayable debts are cancelled en masse since we foolishly have a debt based system that means money vanishes every time a debt is discharged in foreclosure or in bankruptcy court it is this sudden sharp contraction in the money supply that creates all the unemployment 
i have quoted dr steve keen many times before we are headed to the worst financial crisis in the past five centuries because we have more unpayable debts to cancel than at any time in the past  years 
so what is worse than the fourth reich tens of millions of americans starving to death or killing their neighbors because they have nothing to eat 
in short a race war to end all wars 
of course this is what americas elite had planned for them they stole all of the pension funds and the savings they created the trade deals that closed  manufacturing plants and sent millions of jobs overseas they added  million people to the countrys population through legal and illegal immigration they papered over unemployment by using funny money to hire  million federal state and local workers making it appear like everyone was engaged in productive work they used funny money to give out unearned benefits to tens of million of people to minimize starvation until the day of reckoning 
the day of reckoning has arrived 
the  year treasury bonds interest rate at  is at record highs for recent years that means the crash and the nationwide food riots and the race wars will soon be upon us it was only zero interest rates that kept the ponzi scheme going this long 
the only exit path i see is for the us military to be asked to stop the food riots as soon as they begin to ravage the country 
and the junior officers in the military must respond by arresting bankers and seizing their assets to fund debt cancellation 
only debt cancellation will provide a painless way out of the coming financial collapse"

253,"proud shares 
the nras magazine acknowledged that president obama really hasnt had the opportunity to confiscate firearms undercutting years of fearmongering about the supposed existence of a  massive obama conspiracy  to dismantle the second amendment and take guns away 
the nras admission that a president cant confiscate guns because congress writes the laws not the president also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the nra that link hillary clinton to gun confiscation 
the admission was included in a june  article for nra magazine americas st freedom which took issue with how obama rudely responded to a question from a gun store owner at a recent town hall event 
the article quoted obama as telling the questioner im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
responding to obamas statement the article acknowledged now the gun store ownercould have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president 
rhude didnt sit down after asking his question rather he stood silently as president obama didnt even try to answer his question but instead went off on a defensive tirade first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it 
obama then said im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true 
now rhude could have interrupted the president to mention that obama really hasnt had the opportunity to do that congress writes the laws not the president he could then have listed the many attacks on the right to bear arms  from operation fast and furious to operation choke point to obamas attempted ban on common ammunition for artype rifles to his using a pen and phone to push antigun executive actions but rhude respectfully stayed silent 
claims about gun confiscation and obama have been the nras bread and butter for the past eight years  more recently the nra has suggested that the election of clinton could lead to gun confiscation for lawabiding americans

a massive explosion of a gas pipeline in shelby county alabama  near the site where the same pipeline leaked some  gallons of gasoline just last month  evidences the exact reason activists and native american water protectors oppose the construction of the dakota access pipeline over  miles to the northwest 
one person was killed and at least five people were injured in the blast  tentatively described as an accident  as colonial pipeline shut down operations black smoke billowed sending millions into a panic over the abrupt and unexpected coming gas shortage 
our deepest condolences go out tonight to the family and friends of the person who was lost today and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured colonial said in a statement reported nbc news  
cited by the chicago tribune  alabama governor robert bentley said the explosion occurred roughly a mile west of last months rupture adding of the likely crippling shortage of fuel well just hope and pray for the best 
it appears to have been an accident and theyre allowing fuel to burn bentley told wbrc  its about one mile west of where the repair took place on the colonial pipeline just recently liveon  brianpia reports on colonial pipeline company history after todays explosion in shelby county httpstcojjmncsce pictwittercomyntwos 
 abc  news abc october   
refined gas poured from the pipeline as workers rushed to construct a footlong earthen dam to contain the flaming spill where fuel will then be allowed to burn itself out dry tinder from an ongoing drought in the area quickly ignited two wildfires after the explosion  which then charred  acres  and area residents were forced to evacuate without any indication when they would be permitted to return 
theres a large plume of smoke theres a large fire noted shelby county sheriffs captain jeff hartley as quoted by the chicago tribune  were not sure exactly how it started or what caused it he said adding of the massive deployment of fire and emergency personnel weve got first responders entering the area and a lot of them 
apart from the worker killed subsequent reports downplayed the extent of injuries suffered by those at the blast site alcom reported seven of the eight or nine subcontractors working in the area had suffered severe burns from the explosion according to shelby county sheriff john samaniego two of those workers  all of whom had begun digging in an effort to flush one of the lines as repairs continued on the original leak  may still be missing  though that information was both unconfirmed and unclear because extreme heat from flames emanating at the site of the explosion prevented further assessment 
colonial noted in a brief statement cited by a local abc affiliate that both pipelines  one transporting gasoline the other distillates had been shut down and further 
colonials top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public 
according to a later report from reuters  the fire had been contained by around  pm local time  yet no further word about the possiblymissing subcontractors has been provided incredible video of the colonial pipeline leak from ryan burtis our thoughts  prayers to all pictwittercomnuodoawo 
 wbrc fox news wbrcnews october   
fears of yet another gas shortage akin to that from the september leak  as well as consequent soaring prices  spawned lengthy lines at gas stations as soon as news of the explosion hit headlines reuters explains 
colonial the biggest refined products system in the united states is responsible for supplying about onethird of the  million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the east coast according to us energy department data 
further it was not clear whether the explosion happened on the gasoline or the distillates pipeline the governor said in the briefing 
although the aforementioned details handily summarize the facts of the explosion  occurring during active repairs of the previous sizeable leak  the facts do little to quantify potential environmental and health impacts of an explosion and leak of this magnitude 
this explosion of a major pipeline supplying fuel to large portions of the southeast and east coast serves an ominous portent for ongoing opposition to construction of the hotly contentious dakota access pipeline slated to cross four states traversing just north of the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota 
standing rock sioux water protectors and native americans and indigenous peoples from over  nations and their supporters fear that pipelines route  undercutting the missouri river in several places  threatens to poison the tribal water supply and that of no less than  million others living downstream indeed the colonial pipelines tragic mishap  the second in essentially the same section of pipe in about one month  darkly parallels the hundreds of similar accidents such pipelines are prone to 
residents of bismarck aware of big oils horrendous safety record managed to thwart energy transfer partners original plans for the pipeline to be routed near the city  so etp with assistance from the state diverted dakota access to cross just north of the standing rock sioux reservation on privatelyowned land 
rightly viewed by pipeline opponents as blatant exploitation of native americans  as well as a violation of an  treaty with the us government  standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters have camped along the missouri for months in an effort to halt construction as a lawsuit languishes in federal court 
big oil big banks  and government backers obviously view future profiteering from the pipeline important enough to send in absurdly militarized police from at least five states to combat pipeline opponents  who have remained on the whole peaceful prayerful and unarmed 
etp insists the opposition is misguided and dakota access offers a safe alternative to the riskier oil transportation methods of railroad and tanker truck  but even the companys own records listing thousands of spills in just the last six years flatly dispute such claims worse although pipeline leaks and spills might technically be less frequent than those caused by railroad accidents the international energy agency notes pipeline mishaps leaked three times more crude over an eightyear period 
in fact big oils general safety record is nearly impossible to fully track in part because such spills leaks explosions and other accidents are startlingly common and no less perilous to workers residents the environment  and yes the rapidly dwindling water supply 
a report by the center for effective government attempting to map and quantify crude and other industry spills found not only are ruptures and leaks a daily occurrence but eighty people have died and  have been injured in such incidents in the last five years 
since  over  incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on us pipelines these incidents have killed  people injured  more and cost  billion in damages they also released toxic polluting chemicals in local soil waterways and air 
according to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration as noted in the report  those spills and ruptures sent  million gallons of crude into the environment further illustrating the imperative to oppose construction of dakota access one of the worst spills occurred in north dakota  not by human error or poor maintenance  but when lightning struck a crude oil pipeline spilling  gallons of crude into a wheat field in  
while the oil and gas industry and its wealthy proponents in government would attempt to pull the wool over the publics eyes about pipeline safety using crafty language and skewed statistics the truth is no safe manner for transporting oil and gas actually exists 
opposition to the dakota access pipeline simply isnt confined to a native american issue as exploitive as that facet is  but when pipelines traverse pristine lands farm acreage and the rivers and waterways we depend on to sustain us were all at risk 
what scant corporate media coverage of the standing rock sioux tribes stand against big oil does exist has painted the fight as limited in scope but thousands encamped along the pipelines planned route  who face an unusually bitter winter  no less  are in fact taking a stand for every person and every creature who would be devastated in the event of a future oil spill share"

258,"the hostility and hypocrisy of leftwing israeli ngos where are the condemnations of the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel november   
originally written for the investigative project on terrorism 
israeli human rights group btselem recently appeared before a special session of the united nations security council excoriating israel and pleading with the body to act against israels settlements 
in  the un famously declared that zionism is racism and four decades later the organization continues to hound israel in each of the last four years as the syrian bloodbath claimed hundreds of thousands of lives there were at least five times as many resolutions condemning israel as those rebuking the rest of the world 
the uns cultural body unesco recently passed a motion ignoring any jewish or christian historical ties to east jerusalem holy sites referring to the temple mount and western wall only by their muslim names and condemning israel as the occupying power it turns out that some of israels leftwing ngos worked to help produce the unesco motion 
given the uns chronic hostility efforts by israeli ngos to persuade the un to act against israel are arguably treasonous indeed one attorney and activist for israels leftleaning labor party filed a police complaint alleging treason against btselem arguing that the ngo has harmed state sovereignty tried to give land away to a foreign entity and taken steps that could cause a war 
israeli democracy is extremely tolerant to the point of allowing its members of parliament to openly support terrorism and terrorist groups last march several israeli arab knesset members condemned arab states for labeling hizballah a terrorist organization even though it has been at war with israel for decades and regularly threatens new hostilities 
last february members from the joint arab list paid a solidarity visit to relatives of palestinian terrorists whom israeli security forces had killed to stop them from murdering israelis in  mk hanin zoabi balad drew praise from hamas after she asserted that the kidnappers of three missing israeli youths were not terrorists hamass connection to the young mens abduction and murder helped to spark the third war between israel and hamas in gaza 
thus israel already has plenty of dissenting voices and activists without foreign intervention nevertheless foreign interests have identified israeli ngos as the soft underbelly of israeli democracy and have leveraged them to promote their own agendas the problem became so acute that a watchdog ngo monitor was formed in  to track the selfhostility being funded largely by european and other foreign sources as the organization notes ngos lack a system of checks and balances andprovide accountability to their funders and activist members and not to the citizens or societies whose lives are directly impacted by their activities 
ngo monitor also notes that even though most of the foreign government funding for these israeli ngos is formally designated for educating the israeli public and changing public opinion both in violation of the norms on noninterference in other democracies these israeli ngos are very active externally in the delegitmization and political warfare against israel 
these leftwing israeli ngos receive money from about two dozen foreign governments  and some private organizations  that includes millions of dollars from billionaire george soros 
in catch the jew  author tuvia tenenbom exposed how foreignfunded human rights and cultural organizations in israel tend to serve as vehicles for attacking israel by presenting himself to interview subjects as tobi the german tenenbom elicits some surprising confessions for example the new fund for cinema and tv a foreignfunded israeli cultural ngo told him that that about  percent of political documentaries made in israel are coproduced by europeans that includes a documentary called what makes a hero which equates israels military with the nazis such films would be too scandalous to be produced in germany but germansponsored ngos can safely pay leftwing israelis to make such movies 
some foreign funders of israeli ngos have even unwittingly enriched hamas last august hamas allegedly siphoned off tens of millions of dollars from world vision a usbased charity and used the funds for weapons purchases tunnel construction and other military activities 
the knesset passed a law in july requiring disclosure of foreign funding sources for ngos that get more than half of their money from overseas the law is clearly aligned with the american foreign agents registration act fara wrote legal scholar eugene kontorovich who defended the legislation in response to critics 
israel is unique in the sheer scale of the foreign government sponsorship of domestic political groups he wrote for example the european union alone has in recent years given roughly  million euro a year for political ngos in the us and roughly an order of magnitude more in israela vastly larger per capita amount 
the obama administration opposes foreign influence only when that influence promotes a dissenting view obama opposed netanyahus speech to the us congress against the iranian nuclear deal but was happy to give a speech to the uk parliament against brexit the obama administration critiqued israels ngofundingdisclosure law  perhaps because it had sent us taxpayer money to an israeli ngo working to oust israels prime minister 
the same hypocrisy seems to prevail among israels foreignfunded ngos they ostensibly exist to promote democracy and peaceful coexistence but are conspicuously silent when palestinian institutions violate those ideals such silence enables abuse by palestinians and promotes a distorted and incomplete picture of the complex reality in which israelis operate foreignfunded israeli ngos remained silent after the palestinian authority arrested palestinians who visited a sukkah in a symbolic peace event promoting coexistence 
these organizations are silent when the palestinian leadership pays salaries to the families of terrorists glorifies murderers and calls streets and city centers after them netanyahu said these organizations prove again and again that they are not actually interested in human rights but only in shaming israel and libeling it around the world 
if israels leftwing ngos truly are committed to democracy and peace why havent they condemned the pas efforts to prevent normalization with israel in  jibril rajoub the deputy secretary of the fatah central committee and the head of the palestinian supreme council for sport and youth affairs condemned a coexistencepromoting soccer match between israeli and palestinian youths on a southern kibbutz as a crime against humanity 
last week a palestinian newspaper came under intense criticism for publishing an interview with israeli defense minister avigdor liberman the jerusalembased newspaper alquds was denounced by hamas  the palestinian journalists syndicate and the supposedly moderate pa the chilling effects and antipeace message implicit in the harsh reactions to the interview have yet to catch the attention of any leftwing ngos supposedly working for peace and democracy"

it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

261,"if you cant give something away change is needed
httpwwwtextbooksfreeorge"
262,"as the election is inching slowly towards its end experts are nervously scrambling to find any dirt that would stop the trump train
first megyn kelly pulled the sexist card then it was his undisclosed tax returns then his comments on john mccain then making fun of crippled reporters then his reading of mein kampf then his remarks about dating his daughter
then accusations of racism from former employees his usage of eminent domain hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices the trump university scandal his blunder on abortion old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control his relationship with the clintons and the dc insiders his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants the khan incident and of course the pussygrabbing scandal

surely this time it will sink his campaign wont it  and yet each time teflon don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments nothing seems to be able to stop him not that his opponents will ever stop trying
trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician howard deans yeehaw was enough to end his bid for the democratic candidate in  and yet trump can call for an end to muslim refugees be accused of grabbing women by their loins and end up being praised for it by the masses while the mainstream media spew their bile 

what has allowed trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections including being able to reach people directly through twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media as well as his biggerthanlife persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for
but thats the story for another article i would rather talk about something else particularly is there anything that could stop him the answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom
yes but its not what you think
trumps weak spot 
one of the biggest problems with defeating trump is that unlike other politicians political scandals not only seem to not affect him but they even aid him there is a saying that every antitrump meme is also a protrump meme

trump has mastered political antifragility which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him trump has defeated the lefts no platform for fascists mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him
so the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with ron paul neither can they attack him for each of their attacks only make him more popular

one memorable movie quote i remember went something like this every man has a weak spot first you try to buy him with money then women then you go for his family and if that doesnt work well a bullet always does the job unfortunately unlike other political losers don does not need other peoples money nor does he lack female attention and his family is smart and probably safe from violence
but this isnt an article about god forbid donald trump getting assassinated that would stop trump but not the trump train trump is more than a man trump is an idea he is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology he would become a martyr thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter americas consciousness forever trumps enemies cant afford that
so if ignoring trump does not work throwing dirt at him does not work bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work than what is left the answer might surprise you
you see trumps power comes from his contrarianism he is not a candidate he is an anticandidate people dont just vote for trump they vote against hillary obama progressives and cuckservatives he is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive marxist ideology want to use against the establishment
so what can be done to stop him  
well lets ask ourselves what makes trump popular  his brashness his antipc attitudes his antielitism his not being a part of the establishment hacks his being not one of them his being different
so if that is what gives trump strength it would make sense that to weaken him you would have to present him as the opposite of that to present him as being nothing special to make him look boring and weak to present him as just another pcdrone
theyve claimed nonstop that trump is the next hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate muslims and minorities with right wing death squad robots

instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough and that he wont deliver anything that he is in love with political correctness and respects women that he is a progressives best choice that he will bring four more years of obama
that of course would present its own difficulties in the age of online media the monopoly of physical press has been broken when news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this it is very hard to call trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos
yet as difficult as it may have been at the very least it would have had a chance of success as small as it was calling him sexist racist and other mean words did nothing to stop him and instead only made him more popular with the masses some of these incidents have made donald seem human and it made people trust him more showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo but those who liked him were either left indifferent or whats worse excited by his statements

at worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind however considering what short attention span undecided voters have his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on bills sexual misdeeds instead
why havent his opponents used this against him 
this brings us to the final point of this article why havent his opponents used this against him have they not the brains to figure this out hard to believe considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks
no the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp should his opponents try to attack him as another pc drone they would be also attacking themselves just like hillary trying to paint trump as sex offender only made it easier for trump to point at bills sexual indiscretions as it has been said in the mighty book of kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations the prophecy of kek chapter   verse  

attacking trump for being multicultural politically correct weak inefficient or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness
this means that in order to draw voters away from trump they would have to claim trump loves multiculturalism antiracism open borders free trade globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues

using this strategy against trump even if it was successful would be a pyrrhic victory for his opponents as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back reaganism the truth is the future is bleak for reaganbushcuck wing of the gop even if they were to win the election they would lose the war

the left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections but by cultural metawarfare instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses and so the right wing had no option but do concessions dropping people who opposed civil rights womens liberation and closed borders
to put it simply the battle was lost even before trump cametrump was the match that ignited the powder keg he simply mobilized people and said what others kept in private but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back
the elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore they will have to reform the gop to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history there is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes open borders and the awfulness of bigotry they will have to at least nominally give something back to the people to stay in power
as one wise commenter on this site once said  trump may be a liar like the rest of them but at least he is saying the right lies
the next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be trumplike figures who will copy trumps rhetoric but will fail to deliver any solutions or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger but for now for the first time in more than  years we are winning the culture war

264,"nbcs baghdad bob there is no fbi investigation of hillary november   daniel greenfield 
remember when hillary clinton was insisting that there was no fbi investigation of her just a security review even when the fbi rejected that claim 
well andrea mitchell nbcs own baghdad bob isnt giving up that claim so easily even while the rest of the clinton clique is screeching against the fbi for investigating hillary like bats from the nether regions of leftwing hell mitchell is sticking to the old spin there is no fbi investigation of hillary  close your eyes and say it three times the fbi is not investigating hillary its not its not 
in a complete state of denial on thursday msnbc host andrea mitchell interrupted live coverage of donald trump speaking at a florida campaign rally to supposedly factcheck the candidate for citing a bombshell report that the fbi was conducting an extensive investigation into hillary clintons email and charitable foundation scandals 
mitchell refused to accept reality just a lot of factchecking to do shes not under criminal investigation in fact its not an investigation its just a review of the emails she did not lie to the fbi according to james comey there was no grounds to prosecute her so there are no lies theres no criminality she fretted i dont know even where to startbut i mean we have to put it in some context 
the context is that defending hillary clinton has become a mental illness 
but as i wrote earlier this week fact checking has become a media term for insisting on the primacy of its alternate reality even when it flies in the face of actual reality there is no fbi investigation of hillary anyone who believes that is probably some sort of rightwinger who listens to what the fbi actually says rather than what nbc says that the fbi says"
265,"i remember signing up for facebook ten years ago at this point in time the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of  to have an account 
but over the last decade weve seen facebook morph into a  billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds this beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions gather nefarious amounts of data foster unnecessary personal dramas and often cause more harm than good for its users 
it would be prudent to take a good hard look at your facebook experience and ask yourself if its something thats actually adding value to your life here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the worlds largest social media site 
 your facebook feed is a black hole of completely worthless information 
i think its important to create streams of information that add real value to your life through platforms such as twitter feedly and youtube ive followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to selfimprovement entrepreneurship higher meaning and the search for truth 
so you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated twitter feed and the dumbeddown facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the th grade 
log into your facebook and the most common information youll likely find is who got married who had kids and who got fat scrolling through your facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line 
every time i log onto facebook im immediately reminded why i never log onto facebook 
 its no longer useful for dating 
in college i gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers 
but over the years most girls have attached the creepy stigma to guys who hit them up via facebook messenger 
in addition to that you dont really need a facebook profile for social proof as you once did since instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls  
 forfeiture of your privacy 
most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on facebook theyre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions dont let that one drunk picture of you from  years ago ruin a potential job offer 
if that wasnt enough facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy theyve already been caught accessing your location without permission we can only speculate what else theyve been infringing on

 censorship 
although facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on its platform that doesnt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive 
much like an overbearing parent facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion you can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle

 it brings out the worst in people 
plenty of time has now passed for indepth research to come out regarding the longterm effects that too much facebook can have on a persons mental wellbeing it gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isnt fair this is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances how oppressed these chronic facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in starbucks and scroll through their facebook feeds on the latest macbook

i wont completely deny the merits of facebook if youre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time simply because so many people actively use it ive also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they havent seen in decades 
but the truth is that in many cases facebook does cause more trouble than its worth its never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely you may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what brad and sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years but i suspect you might be better off as a person

266,"what we all should be doing first thing in the morning a simple cheap and effective way to jump start your metabolism weight loss and improve your health 
what if i told you that by doing this every day making it part of your morning routine just like brushing your teeth would help you to lose weight flush out toxins hydrate your body and skin improve brain function give you more energy and decrease your appetite would you do it 
drinking water upon rising in the morning can have huge health benefits some people call it water therapy and has its origination in ayurvedic medicine it is purported to help with numerous diseases such as cancer asthma high blood pressure arthritis diabetes and migraines 
to reap the benefits drink the water upon waking ideally  minutes before you eat and make it part of your morning routine most us are walking around in a dehydrated state so start your day off the right way 
ideally filtered water that is void of chemicals and fluoride is best i personally like the berkey filter system as this is affordable for many instead of a whole house system most water pitchers are ineffective for removing most of the chemicals in our water but there are a couple good ones out there such as the clearly filtered pitcher but even if you dont have a water filter system it does not mean you should not drink up 
for most people  oz of water in the morning is the right amount others say to drink double this amount this may be a lot of water to consume for most people first thing in the morning my suggestion would be to start out with  oz and slowly work your way up to the higher amount and see how you feel moderation is key as too little or too much water is never a good thing 
the  glasses filled with  oz of water is a myth and no science behind this reasoning another simple rule is to divide your body weight in half and drink this amount in ounces but if you are a large person this may feel like you are spending your day drinking water 
instead focus on getting that glass of water first thing in the day and then add in water herbal teas fruits and vegetables during the day if your urine is very pale yellow throughout the day then you are hydrated if it is a bright yellow to orange drink up riboflavin a b vitamin can make your urine a bright yellow benefits to drinking water first thing in the morning it can jump start your metabolism 
it can increase your metabolism by  for the first  minutes after consuming that glass of water another study showed that it can increase your metabolic rate by  for the next  minutes after the water is consumed hydration this is more important that you think when dehydrated we may experience brain fog lack of energy and metal clarity hydrating in the morning can increase the flow of oxygen which is energizing hydrating will also help the skin to look younger flushes out toxins 
support your kidneys by helping them to flush out toxins and give your body the water it needs first thing in the am speed up the detox process by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to your morning water this is best done prior to brushing your teeth in the morning as the film on your teeth will protect the enamel from the acidity in the lemon juice support brain health 
your brain tissue is  water not having enough water can make you feel tired drained and can cause mood swings prevent you from overeating just by drinking water you feel full studies show that those who consume water before every meal lost an average of  pounds over a threemonth period thats with no dieting not changing your eating habitsjust adding in water less colds and flu 
staying hydrated helps to maintain the health of your lymphatic system which also affects how your body fights off infection 
if you are looking for a simple cheap and effective way to improve your health and stimulate weight loss then this is it

evidence makes it clear that the violent american establishment engages in browbeating inciting socalled color revolutions to destabilize and overthrow disobedient governments military encirclement and saber rattling this selfdescribed indispensable nation which preens its might before major nation states such as china and russia was not about to have its fullspectrum dominance challenged by punk computer hackers
leaning on its allies the us enacted a financing squeeze on wikileaks many nation states have been severely crippled and devastated by us sanctions but tiny wikileaks proved more resilient and cleverer than the washington schemers
in an attempt to topple wikileaks the us establishment has sought to lop off the head of wikileaks it has kept close tabs on julian assange and is purportedly behind a scheme to bring assange down in sweden we have been warned that the pentagon for example is thinking of deploying dirty tricks to ruin us
in sweden consensual sex has been parlayed as rape in selfdefense assange spoke to the facts of the situation 
here we have a case the swedish case where i have never been charged with a crime where i have already been cleared by the stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent where the woman herself said that the police made it up where the united nations formally said the whole thing is illegal where the state of ecuador also investigated and found that i should be given asylum those are the facts but what is the rhetoric
 the un formally found that the whole thing is illegal never even mentioning that ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes i am subject to persecution by the united states
disinformation and distraction are among the underhanded tactics of empire
while in britain assange was eventually placed under house arrest sweden played out the drama while refusing to press charges or interview assange in britain on the allegations it insisted he come to sweden which assange was unwilling to do without an assurance that he would not be deported elsewhere knowing full well that the us department of justice was preparing a case against him sweden refused to give such an assurance which speaks strongly about swedens intent to seek justice for any alleged crimes committed against its citizens
despite all this intrigue wikileaks has continued to publish and assange has continued to give interviews assange did not cower instead he chose to fight back against hillary clinton and the democrats this is because hillary clinton and the democrats are the principals in power and the grand jury investigation into himself and wikileaks has been occurring during their time in government
clinton and the democrats are victims of their own zeal and hubris along the way many outs presented themselves to the democrats they could have dropped the grand jury investigation they could have provided an assurance that there would be no request for assanges deportation from sweden the us could even have given a presidential pardon to assange extremely telling about the caliber of man that assange is is that he offered himself as a prisoner in exchange for the release of another political prisoner chelsea manning
but empire and its minions were dismissive as is the way of empire empire does not negotiate deals it takes what it wants because it believes it can
the result
the corruption in the democratic party has come to light wikileaks revealed that the democratic national committee conspired against party aspirant bernie sanders and heads fell clinton tellingly hired the subsequently fallen dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz
clintons emails were leaked as were those of her campaign chair john podesta revelations include payforplay as they call it giving access in exchange for money to states individuals and corporations a  direct connection between hillary clinton and the foundation of jihadism of isil in the middle east libya more than anyone elses war was hillary clintons war and banks buying cabinet positions
the clinton campaign has predictably been thrown into disarray
the clintonites could not refute what was in their own emails instead they sought to deflect attention elsewhere the clintonites blamed russian hacking for interfering in the us presidential race finally julian assange felt compelled to state 
the clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neomccarthy hysteria that russia is responsible for everything hilary clinton stated multiple times falsely that seventeen us intelligence agencies had assessed that russia was the source of our publications that is false we can say that the russian government is not the source
neither is wikileaks complicit with russia
we have published about  documents of various kinds that relate to russia most of those are critical and a great many books have come out of our publications about russia most of which are critical our russiadocuments have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in russia which they use our documents to back up
graciously toward clinton assange said he feels sorry for the woman who wanted to  drone  him imagine what the response would have been if assange had discussed the possibility of a drone attack against clinton
presently assange downplays the damage from the barrage of leaks to the clinton campaign for the presidency
trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because hes had every establishment off side trump doesnt have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them an establishment but banks intelligence agencies arms companies big foreign money  are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and even journalists themselves
however a counter coup was announced against the coup by clinton cronyism it is said to include fbi cia military intelligence other security organizations through julian assange that have promised to stop clinton from becoming president and to convict and indict her and her cronies
a revolution

a source said the stress of her political career the neverending scandals and her worsening health plunged her into a lifethreatening booze hell she turned to drink to drown her fears hillary tries to hide her problem like she lies about so many things a close friend of hillary added  hillary has been drinking heavily for years to forget her miserable marriage to serial cheater bill shes also hit the bottle to cope with other stress as well as the boredom of flying all over the world when she was secretary of state 
one hillary insider told the enquirer that hillary has blackouts and wakes up wondering where she is and what she has done  and that shes not fit to be president

wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behindthescenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in american history 
remember the first debate between hillary clinton and donald trump and the conspiracy surrounding podiumgate  
hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didnt want to appear shorter than trump 
after the debate was over however a sneaky cleaner man was caught on tape approaching hillarys podium multiple times removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it what could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in trumps just after the debate officially ended 
this led to lots of speculation on whether or not hillary cheated during the first debate against trump and other debates as well having her comments fed to her 
well if the wikileaks podesta emails are any indication its very possible why a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
because apparently hillary cant give long speeches without a podium 
in fact these emails and this isnt even all of them but enough for you to get the picture prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept short and sweet unless hillary has a podium 
so how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow

trump kept saying were in a room of liars the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong he addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest deceitful liars he called out jeff zucker by name and said everyone at cnn was a liar and cnn was a network of liars the source said 
trump didnt say nbc reporter katy tur by name but talked about an nbc female correspondent who got it wrong then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when hillary lost who hosted a debate  which was martha raddatz who was also in the room

isis transported hundreds of girls to the city of douma which has been at the center of the syrian civil war to be slaughtered isis has been systematically killing nonmuslims and the majority of its victims at the time were christian 
assaf said her own son george was killed by the radical militants after he refused to switch to a muslim name 
my son said to me no mother i dont want to die with an identity not my own i prefer to die with the name george assaf said according to the christian post

283,"why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society 
andré is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   culture 
the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years 
so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals 
at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer 
when modernity reared its philosophical head through rené descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression 
the irish bishop george berkeley  criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume  scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything 
there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds 
the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrés started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same 
such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter 
it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them 
the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and émile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism 
voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence 
zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story 
voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress 
thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay 
even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protégé  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts 
today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them 
in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily 
old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition 
but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction 
the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function 
if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion 
the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right 
culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture 
the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels 
some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  rené guénon introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap rené guénon young 
philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others rené guénon the crisis of the modern world  chap rené guénon older 
the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola

284,"harvard cancels mens soccer season after finding sexually explicit reports continued through  andrew m duehren et al harvard crimson november   
harvard has cancelled the mens soccer teams season after an office of general counsel review found that the team continued to produce vulgar and explicit documents rating women on their perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance 
athletics director robert l scalise wrote in an email to harvard student athletes that he decided to cancel the rest of the teams season because the practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond  including in  
as a direct result of what harvard athletics has learned we have decided to cancel the remainder of the  mens soccer season scalise wrote the team will forfeit its remaining games and will decline any opportunity to achieve an ivy league championship or to participate in the ncaa tournament this year 
last week the crimson reported that the  mens soccer team created a scouting report of that years womens soccer recruits rating them numerically and assigning each a hypothetical sexual position university president drew g faust instructed ogc harvards team of lawyers to review the matter 
snip 
the decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential and reflects harvards view that both the teams behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable have no place at harvard and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community faust wrote in a statement 
faust wrote she was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the  mens soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals 
snip 
last week when scalise first saw the documentswhich were until recently publicly accessible through the  teams google grouphe said he would immediately reach out to coaches of both mens and womens teams to discuss the report but added that any response should be internal to harvard and not a media thing

mens soccer coach pieter s lehrer wrote in a statement that the team is beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way but we respect the decision made by our administration

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name"
288,"keywords body detox  breath  breathing exercises  breathing techniques 
breathing  a process that goes almost unnoticed and happens on such a deep subconscious level yet it is vital for our being nowadays there are more and more cases of people breathing incorrectly 
living in a big city surrounded by constant stress pollution and technology can sometimes bring the body out of sync with the natures flow young children know how to breathe correctly on an intuitive level their body follows the rhythm of nature 
with time as the stress increases and obstacles come into our lives we quickly forget our calm manner of breathing and switch to a frantic one instead without even realizing it cancer prevention 
in  dr otto warburg received a nobel prize when he proved that cancer cells are anaerobic  this means that they cannot survive in high levels of oxygen when a body is low on oxygen some cells start to replace it by fermenting sugar a normal cell gets its energy through a process of respiration of oxygen whereas a cancer cell does it through fermentation cardiovascular health 
hypertension is all too common quite often as a result of stress in order to lower the blood pressure its important to decrease the stress levels  one of the oldest and most natural ways to do that is through deep slow breathing not only does it calm your heart beat but it allows the blood to flow at a more even pace 
research was conducted over a  year period that showed how proper breathing can prolong the lifespan  as well as increase general health the framingham study found a correlation between the vital capacity meaning the largest amount of air that can be expelled from the lungs after a deep breath and the lifespan of that person an increased vital capacity means a potentially longer lifespan cure for depression 
brain needs oxygen to work just like any other organ in the body stroke has a tendency to leave the body paralyzed as a result one of the causes is the lack of oxygen supply to the brain during a stroke this is an extreme example but looking on a smaller scale there is a connection between improper breathing and depression long periods of even a slightly limited air supply to the body caused by improper breathing can lead to a decrease in cognitive functions symptoms such brain fog forgetfulness lack of concentration and in the end depression are all interconnected increased energy levels 
have you ever told someone youre tired and in return you were told to go for a walk or do a light exercise this is because the body converts oxygen into energy through a process called cellular respiration  when you inhale the air correctly more of it gets to your body thus increasing the energy levels through conversion it is also one of the reasons why people who exercise on a regular basis are generally more energetic than those with sedentary lifestyles different breathing techniques 
there is a countless number of breathing techniques for different purposes and each one of them has its own benefits breathing exercises can lower or raise blood pressure improve sleep help with anxiety and much more 
yoga is one of the practices that incorporates breathing exercises called pranayama as an essential part of the process coming from the east its uncertain when exactly yoga originated but there is evidence that it has been around for at least  years  yogic breathing techniques have been applied for thousands of years making them timeproof i will share with you a couple of my favorite breathing techniques that i personally use in different situations best body detoxifier 
kapalbhati is a breathing technique that detoxifies your body opens up your nasal passages and allows your mind to concentrate after doing the exercise you will feel a rush of energy that will immediately wake you up 
instructions sit comfortably with a straight spine place your left hand on the knee with the palm facing upwards and your right hand on the stomach take a deep breath quickly exhale while exhaling pull the stomach in as if youre trying to touch the back and do it to an extent that feels comfortable however do not apply strength or pressure beyond the level of comfort  repetitions per set come back to normal breathing after each set and observe your bodys sensations its advised to do  repetitions daily sleeping and stress reducing technique 
its a simple slow breathing  exercise that helps you fall asleep faster or calm down during an anxiety attack all you have to do is fully exhale through your mouth with a sound whoosh with a closed mouth slowly inhale with your nose on a count of four hold your breath for seven seconds exhale fully through your mouth on a count of eight  making a whoosh sound repeat until you feel sleepy or calm"

weve all seen pictures of the trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor complete with their young son barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents its a life most of us can never imagine while were paying our monthly bills so whats it like growing up with donald trump as a father according to scott melker a former classmate of donald trump jrs at the university of pennsylvania being the former reality show stars son wasnt what one might imagine or given trumps temperament it might be exactly what youd imagine 
on facebook  mekler told of the animosity trumps son had for this father 
i was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends next door to donald jrs room i walked out of the room to find donald trump at his sons door there to pick him up for a baseball game he recalls there were quite a few students standing around watching trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate don jr opened the door wearing a yankee jersey 
then mekler told of the moment trump slapped his son in the face in front of others 
without saying a word his father slapped him across the face knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates he simply said put on a suit and meet me outside and closed the door melker wrote 
donald jr was a drunk in college every memory i have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking he continued he absolutely despised his father and hated the attention that his last name afforded him his nickname was diaper don because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other peoples beds and urinate i always felt terrible for him he continued 
mekler said part of his reason for voting for hillary clinton is because in light of what i saw that day it is clear to me that donald trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country 
to be clear we are not demonizing trumps son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days whether melkers story is accurate or not were not sure but given trumps awful temper its difficult to discount it

it appears bill and hillary clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event donald trump wins this election 
reports are circulating that the clintons have transferred  billion dollars from the clinton foundation to the qatar central bank via a facilitationabatement of jp morgan chase  company for reasons not revealed 
this move of such a large sum of money to the country of qatar says in itself hillary clinton knows she is going to lose the election and she doesnt plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a trump administration 
the country of qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the united states thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice 
donald trump has said many times during his campaign and at the presidential debates that once he gets into office he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server all the way to gun running to terrorist groups in syria resulting in the deaths of  americans in benghazi 
apparently hillary is not the only person in washington who has made plans to escape justice under a trump administration john kerry has quietly been selling his property in the us for millions of dollars of late with an announcement of the sale of his  million dollar nantucket mansion in june  as well as the sale of his yacht for  million in july  
president barack h obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a  million dollar seaside mansion in dubai in january  another non extradition country 
snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of obamas purchase of the mansion and the firing of rear admiral rick williams however over the last several months these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned when in fact the information is true 
snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed but the truth has a way of coming out on its own as it always has"

a company that makes trump and hillary kippas or yarmulkes has some good news for one of the presidential hopefuls  trump head coverings are winning in a landslide among the orthodox jewish clientele 
so far the company picakippa has sold  trump yarmulkes to  for clinton 
my kippa yarmulke company sells trump and hillary kippas and are keeping track of who is selling more uri turk founder and chief kippa officer told wnd we see it as an early exit poll of the orthodox jews a type of bellwether of where this important community is leaning once the first debate came around the orders started flying in with much more interest in the trump kippas 
picakippa is the brainstorm of two former elite red beret idf soldiers from miami turk says the company is the leader in the kippa market and has been selling trump and hillary custom kippas on its site since august all the while keeping a running tally of which one has sold more 
our mission is to help jews everywhere show and wear their jewish pride with our beautifully unique and completely customizable picture kippas the company says on its website 
it donates  percent of every kippa sale to the lone soldier center in israel assisting young lone soldiers during difficult times 
turk said while american jews have leaned heavily democratic for decades the past few presidential races have seen orthodox jews who make up over  percent of american jewry vote republican in ever increasing numbers he attributes that fact to the democrats putting daylight between america and israel 
a number of influential jewish protrump organizations have emerged chief among them jews choose trump and jewish democrats for trump a recent poll of florida jews showed orthodox voters are leaning toward trump by a  margin 
according to turk picakippa has sold many trump kippas to a congregant of ivanka trumps synagogue on the liberal upper east side of manhattan and has gotten orders for trump kippas from israel australia britain and even mexico picakippa has also gotten hate mail from jews unhappy they are selling the trump designs he says"

297,"by rmuse    pm if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophic   the following is an opinion column by r muse 
it may be the understatement of the year to say the republican party is on the verge of a fullon civil war and it may be obvious to many americans that the blame for the interparty discord is its standard bearer donald j trump however much trumps candidacy has contributed to the tensions between establishment types terrified of trumps reckless disregard for the longevity of the party and rebellionminded trump supporters the real instigators are the koch brothers 
although the oil magnates were never on the trump bandwagon they are responsible for the trump loyalists within the gop who were part of the teabagger movement intent on disrupting the nations political system and indeed the workings of government itself the tea party caucus an extremist sect that succeeded in chasing former house speaker john a boehner out of congress morphed into the inaptly named freedom caucus that has embraced trump are set to set fire to the party establishment and it isnt solely to put current speaker paul ryan out of a job although that is high on the trump supporters todo list 
as noted in wednesdays new york times  mr trumps supporters said they were determined to harness the antiestablishment energy that mr trump had catalyzed and to refocus it on the republican leadership in congress  a target many of them seemeager to take down  
the rightwing extremist that actually  took down  former house majority leader eric cantor conservative extremist and house freedom caucus member david brat issued a warning to establishment republicans 
 theres a huge chunk of people who want to see a fight taken to dc leadership comes and smacks our guy thats where youre going to put down a marker really and the american people are just scratching their head saying really thats rich  
brat has been a thorn in the establishments side since paul ryan became speaker and he joins a dangerous number of  real conservatives  who cannot understand or comport with ryan and establishment leaders who dared criticize trump instead of using their majority advantage to go after hillary clinton 
donald trump and a few of his  senior aides  are prodding extremist conservatives to revolt against the establishment leadership after the election for not defending trump in fact besides assailing ryan for not sticking by trump it is reported that trump said privately that ryan should be made to pay a heavy price for disloyalty to the trump candidacy and during an interview with reuters he complained that  the people are very angry with the leadership of this party because this is an election that we will win  percent if we had support from the top  win or lose there is going to be a major bloodletting after the election and the establishment although powerful may face a herculean task to save the party 
this impending conflict within the gop has been brewing longer than donald trump has been a candidate and it may be why he brought on an experienced antiestablishment devotee to run his campaign the chairman of breitbart news stephen bannon had made it one of his primary goals to get paul ryan out as house speaker because he is not a true conservative intent on tearing government down to restructure it into an uberconservative paradise and uberconservative is just a different way of saying a  nongovernment  according to the koch brothers vision of american libertarianism dont believe it 
two groups closely aligned with the koch brothers heritage action for america and freedomworks  have been pushing republicans as a party to adopt more extremist positions and see the civil war as a stellar opportunity to have greater influence over the partys decisions something establishment types are resisting 
over the past few days leaders of both koch groups joined extremist conservatives in calling to delay a vote on selecting a candidate to be the next or new speaker of the house something typically occurring directly after the general election in november regardless the outcome 
according to the chief executive of heritage action michael needham there is going to be hell to pay for establishment republicans if they dont bend to the will of the extremist wing created by the kochs and heavily courted by donald trump mr needham said 
 if the party doesnt learn lessons and change based on whats gone on for the last year and a half i think its going to be just catastrophe  
another conservative extremist house freedom caucus member and ardent donald trump supporter echoed needhams sentiment and said  you cant ignore what millions and millions of people have expressed in this election cycle  
the dilemma for republicans after the election no matter the outcome is maintaining a semblance of stability as a political party that doesnt seem likely because if trump loses big or small the extremists will unleash whatever level of hell they can muster on the establishment for daring to criticize any of trumps more outrageous and dangerous comments on the stump if trump wins the extremists will be emboldened to purge the party of any disloyal establishment types and it appears that no matter what happens on november  it will not be the end of hostilities among republicans 
the republican party establishment is in for a reckoning with an extremist wing that was once content threatening the full faith and credit of the united states or shutting down the government as a show of anger after four years of internal bickering over what it means to be a true conservative and the past yearandahalf of incitement by donald trump the republican party faces a serious threat to its longterm survival it is a threat that began about six years ago when the koch brothers ushered in an age of extremist conservatives that donald trump took advantage of to seize control of the republican party"

306,"when the river ran red arthur kemp american renaissance september  
the year is  dodging a flurry of spears the boer commander andries pretorius rides forward to seize a zulu warrior in the midst of an epic battle between more than  warriors and just  boers pretorius has decided to take a zulu alive he wants to send the captive back to his king dingaan to convey surrender terms to the zulu nation 
the warrior has no intention of being taken alive and jabs viciously at pretorius with his assegai this is a zulu spear normally a longshafted throwing weapon but the warrior broke its shank earlier for closequarter stabbing pretorius gives up on capturing the zulu and tries to shoot him 
with a singleshot muzzleloading musket he has only one chance of a hit there is no time to reload in close combat to his horror pretorius sees the smoketrailing ball whiz past the zulus ear at the same time the zulu lunges forward causing pretoriuss horse to stumble backwards throwing the white commander to the ground 
leaping to his feet he meets the attacking zulu who knows he is now on equal terms with the white man who can no longer use his magic shooting stick and carries no weapon comparable to the assegai pretorius is now fighting for his life he just manages to sidestep the spear point striking it away with the butt of his gun 
spinning round the zulu raises his spear high above his head and thrusts down as he has been trained to do in the zulus disciplined army it is a blow that will be fatal if it strikes home but pretorius sees it coming he grabs the spear point with his left hand to ward it away from his chest the sharp point cuts deeply into his palm embedding itself at an angle that makes it impossible for the zulu to pull it out pretorius seizes the zulu by the throat with his free right hand and throws him to the ground in an attempt to strangle him 
the zulu struggles and with the help of two good hands is about to break free when one of pretoriuss men comes upon the scene he pulls the assegai out of the commanders hand and plunges it into the zulus side ending the struggle 
pretorius remounts and heads back to the boer camp for treatment he is not worried as he knows by now that this greatest of all battles between boers and zulus has already been won the main zulu army has been broken in two and the river that runs along one side of the boer camp is stained red with zulu blood the place and the tributary known previously as the ncome will be renamed blood river pretorius knows that the zulu defeat which will include some  killed on the battlefield is a fit revenge for the deception and murder committed by the zulus  months earlier 
prelude to war 
the great clash between the boer and zulu nations was not as leftist historians like to claim the result of ruthless white colonialism suppressing an indigenous people it came about because the zulus rejected an extremely reasonable attempt at negotiation by the boers 
the boers pioneers of dutch french and german descent were the people who opened up much of what was later to become south africa their first antecedents had landed on the southernmost tip of africa in  only  years after the virginia company settled on jamestown island 
when they arrived in the area now known as cape town whites came into contact only with hottentots and bushmen as the number of europeans increased they expanded east and north only meeting their first black tribe the xhosa some  miles away on south africas east coast the xhosas were migrating south fleeing the warlike zulu to the north who were engaged in imperialist expansion of their own 
for just under a century white settlement halted at this eastern frontier border formed by the coast and firm xhosa settlement it was not however a time of peace as xhosa were constantly raiding the boers who lived on the border this caused much harm and discontent among the farmers who blamed the dutchruled colonial government back in cape town for the lawlessness 
it only added to the border farmers grievances when the british took the cape colony from the dutch in  to prevent the colony from falling into french hands during the napoleonic wars it was vital to control the merchant and naval refitting station on the way to the far east the new colonial masters not only started anglicizing the colony when they abolished slavery they offered compensation that amounted to hardly a quarter of a slaves value 
exasperated by incessant xhosa attacks and british attempts to suppress their language and culture groups of frontier farmers filled with a sense of manifest destiny not seen again until the opening of the american west set forth to the north and the east in a movement known as the great trek the trekkers they became known as voortrekkers or pioneers only after  bypassed the xhosa in search of new unsettled territory in which they could establish independent boer nations all told it was only a small minority of no more than  boers who made the trek to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions they traveled in several waves of covered oxdrawn wagons much like the conestogas in which americans opened the west 
the boer leader of the time piet retief had written the trekker manifesto in which he spelled out the farmers longheld grievances against the british by the boer wagons had crossed the great mountain range into natal in an act of audacity that few thought possible the range the highest in southern africa had been named the drakensbergthe dragon mountainsbecause they were said to be impassable 
retief had identified a large piece of uninhabited land to the north of the zulu kingdom which lay open to settlement retief knew that if he wanted the land for his people he could take it unopposed however he wanted to live in peace with his zulu neighbors and before taking possession he opened negotiations with the zulu king dingaan he wanted no misunderstanding between the two peoples 
he sent a letter to the zulu king explaining why he wanted to speak to him and first visited dingaans capitala large circle of reed and grass hutson november   retief left the main body of trekkers and went to the zulu kings capital umgungundhlovo the place of the elephant to negotiate a treaty that would allow boers peacefully to settle land adjoining the zulu kingdom dingaan said he would let the boers live in natal if they recovered cattle stolen by a tlokwa chieftain retief and his men did so and dingaan agreed to give the land to the boers 
retief returned to umgungundhlovo on february   to finalize the agreement he arrived with  volunteers including his own son and three children of other menit was common for children to accompany their fathers on expeditions of this kind the next day retief and dingaan formally signed a treatythe zulu king made his mark by scratching an x on the documentgiving possession of the land to the boers delighted the boers sent scouts back to the main encampments to report the successful outcome and made ready to leave as retief and his party were about to saddle up a messenger arrived from dingaan inviting the boer party to a special celebration to mark the signing retief was suspicious but did not want to offend dingaan as they had on previous visits the boers stacked their firearms neatly outside the reed walls and entered the royal enclosure unarmed 
as they ate and drank a zulu impi or warrior unit put on a dance for the guests according to the account of a white missionary who was present the dancing warriors drew ever closer to the boers till they were just in front of the seated whites when the zulu king leaped to his feet and shouted kill the white wizards the impi fell upon the surprised boers some of them drew their hunting knives and tried to fight off the attackers but they were quickly overwhelmed 
the zulu warriors bound the whites with reed ropes and dragged them to hlomo amabutho the hill of execution near the zulu capital there they clubbed the boers to death one by one with retief kept until last and forced to watch his son being murdered after retiefs heart was extracted and presented to dingaan as proof that the boer leader was dead the bodies were left for the vultures in accordance with zulu custom 
dingaan then gave orders for the full might of his army to attack the boer camps the settlers had received the message retief had sent earlier and believed everything had gone well they were therefore completely unprepared and badly undermanned the  men in retiefs party were all dead many other men had gone hunting leaving only a light guard for the women and children the boers were so confident there would be peace that they had not even posted sentries just before dawn barking dogs aroused the outlying wagons then thousands of zulu warriors attacked the several hundred trekkers  women children and old men  as they lay sleeping 
the boer historian gustav preller who interviewed survivors left a harrowing account of the aftermath all around dozens and dozens of bodies  babies who had had their heads smashed open against the wagon wheels women dishonored and in some zulu custom their breasts cut off  in a wagon blood filled to a height of several inches the life blood of an entire family ebbed out where they lay  jan bezuidenhout one of the few young men who had not gone ahead with the retief party grabbed his fourmonthold baby daughter out of her crib and ran off through the undergrowth  having lost his pursuers a few miles away bezuidenhout checked for the first time on his daughter in his arms she was dead a single spear stroke had killed her 
the slaughter became known as the weenen the dutch word for weeping and a town of that name still stands near the site of the  boers camped in the area zulus killed some  including  children the rest survived because grazing requirements for their animals meant that the boer camps had to be widely dispersed if dingaans men had scouted more thoroughly found all the encampments and attacked them simultaneously the slaughter would have been far greater 
pretorius arrives 
the boers now faced their greatest challenge their camps were full of wounded men orphaned children and widows the zulus had stolen an estimated  head of cattle and sheep during the weenen slaughter and ammunition was running low the zulu armies might return at any time and they were a formidable force as the boers discovered when they launched a raid to avenge the massacre on april    trekkers under a divided command of piet uys and hendrik potgieter rode into zulu territory only to be defeated by some  warriors not far from umgungundhlovo in what became known as the battle of italeni 
this new disaster forced the boers to face reality they had to either abandon their quest for independence and return to the cape colony or find some means to fight their way through the widows and orphans argued strongly for pushing on they knew that if they fell back to the cape they would have to live on charity whereas if dingaan could be defeated they could at least recover their livestock many boers were also convinced that god favored them and that setbacks were only a test of faith 
it was at this moment of indecision that a popular lawyer named andries pretorius answered the trekker call for reinforcements and rode into camp with  men and a brass cannon the boers appointed him commander in chief on november  and he immediately began preparing a strike against the zulu 
his means were few a force of only about  boers including three scotsmen set out on november  seeking battle for extra protection the boer column of  wagons traveled four abreast instead of the usual single file each night they formed a circular defensive formation known as a laager 
pretorius realized that even with two frontloading cannon his force was too weak to defeat the zulu army in an open field he therefore decided to draw the enemy into an attack on the boer encampment each day patrols and scouting parties rode ahead sometimes led by pretorius himself to make sure no unexpected surprises were waiting over the horizon 
on december   the boer party reached the zandspruit tributary of the waschbank river it was here that the boer chaplain sarel cilliers first pledged during his nightly sermon that if god helped them defeat the zulus they and their descendents would celebrate that day in honor of god and that they would build a church in commemoration the boers repeated this oath known in afrikaner folklore as the covenant every night until they met the enemy 
there appeared to be no movement from the zulu side on december  pretorius decided to move camp to the buffalo river hoping to provoke the zulus by moving farther into their territory that day he sent out two patrols one under the command of his deputy commandant hans de lange and another under the scotsman edward parker this latter group saw action when they came upon a small group of zulus they killed the warriors and took the women prisoner 
pretorius drew up a message for dingaan on a white cloth explaining that he was leading a commando to punish the zulus if however dingaan was willing to cooperate pretorius wrote he was still willing to make peacea generous offer in light of the earlier betrayal he freed the prisoners and told them to give the message to dingaan he received no answer 
on december  the boers spotted zulus and what appeared to be a large number of cattle near their camp piet uys had been tricked by such a ploy at the battle of italeni zulu warriors crouching behind toughened animalskin shields looked like cattle from a distance and uys dropped his guard he was killed in a surprise attack by the cattle 
pretorius did not make the same mistake and he sent a strong mounted unit to investigate the cattle they turned out to be zulus and in the short fight that followed the boers killed eight warriors but suffered no casualties pretorius now suspected that the zulus were preparing for battle 
on december  he moved the boer camp to a position alongside the ncome river itself a tributary of the buffalo river a scouting expedition that day confirmed the presence of two huge zulu armies a short distance away 
pretorius prepared for battle his men drew the wagons into a dshaped formation one side overlooking a large hippopotamus path facing the ncome river another side facing a soil erosion ditch and the third side facing the open plain pretorius chose the site to limit the directions from which the zulus could attack 
the laager was large enough to contain all the horses and oxen the defenders tied the wagons together with leather ropes and closed off all openings between and below the wagons with a pretorius innovation socalled fighting gates which were slatted wood fixtures through which defenders could fire they left two small openings sealed with removable fighting gates so cavalry could leave the laager finally they attached lanterns to the ends of large oxwhips planted upright in the ground these dangled in front of the laager and were to serve as forward lighting during the dark hours when zulu usually attacked zulus captured after the battle said they had believed the lights waving in the breeze above the boer camp were spirits and that fear of the spirits kept them from attacking that night 
battle is joined 
in pretoriuss own account of the battle he wrote that as the mist cleared on the morning of december  he saw that the boer camp was completely encircled by tens of thousands of zulu warriors even where the terrain would have made an attack difficult estimates placed the number of zulus at between  and  although no official count was possible whatever the figure pretorius wrote that it was a terrible sight 
the boers had been ready and armed since two hours before daybreak the two cannon were in position and the fighting gates closed the defenders expected to run out of ammunition for the cannon and had stacked up suitably sized stones at strategic points along the perimeter to fire as a last resort the boers would fire stones that day 
the front lines of the zulu force were still squatting only about  paces from the wagons waiting for the signal to attack pretorius decided to strike first at his signal three bursts of fire from the boer guns and two blasts from the cannon broke the silence the boers orders were to then hold their fire as the billows of gunpowder smoke lifted they saw that the surviving zulus had fled some  paces from their former front line leaving behind dozens of dying and dead comrades 
the boers then heard the noise of the zulus breaking their spear shafts to make them into short stabbing weapons a frontal assault was coming a few minutes later the zulu force stormed the wagons screaming wildly shields held high and assegais in readiness withering gunfire ripped through the zulu ranks and while some managed to reach the wagons they were gunned down before they could cut through the wagon canvasses 
another group of zulus tried to attack from inside the erosion ditch by standing on each others shoulders and scrambling over the edge pretorius ordered cilliers the fighting churchman to see off the attack he led a group of men out of the relative safety of the wagon perimeter and they proceeded to kill some  zulus one boer philip fourie was wounded when an assegai struck him in the side 
the boers then wheeled one of their cannon out of the laager pointed it into the ditch and fired a shot that literally blew apart the assaulting party the survivors fled the ditch in disarray this sparked a temporary retreat by the zulu and marked the end of the second unsuccessful attempt to break the boer lines the wounded boer fourie returned to the wagon circle for treatment 
as the zulus waited for new orders pretorius ordered another burst of cannon fire into their ranks provoking a spontaneous charge against the wagons although it was the longest single assault of the ninehour battle it was utterly defeated as the boers cut down wave after wave of attackers gun barrels got so hot men had to hold them with wet cloths for reloading 
as the third attack fell back the boers launched their first surprise counterattack as the mobile fighting gates swung open and a cavalry unit charged the zulu lines shooting from the saddle the boers tried to turn the zulu lines to their left desperate zulu resistance which saw hundreds more of their number killed stopped the encircling action and the boer horsemen rode back to the wagons they regrouped and launched a second attempt driving the zulus further away a third mounted charge finally broke through the zulu lines the boer cavalry then turned and attacked the zulus from the rear pinned between the cavalry and cannon fire from within the wagon circle the main zulu force facing the open plain scattered 
a reserve zulu force tried to cross the ncome river to attack the laager but so many warriors were gunned down that their blood stained the water red pretorius himself then led another cavalry charge from within the laager cut to pieces with thousands dead the zulu army which had courageously charged repeatedly against a betterarmed enemy finally broke ranks and fled 
pretorius divided his cavalry into two units and sent them in pursuit mounted boers killed hundreds of warriors during a threehour chase it was during this pursuit that pretorius was wounded two other boers including fourie suffered nonfatal assegai wounds but these were the only boer casualties an estimated  zulus died on the battlefield and many more died later from wounds 
the aftermath 
early the next morning pretorius ordered the camp broken and marched the commando straight to the zulu kings capital he was confident the zulus no longer posed any significant threat but he hardly expected the sight that awaited him on december  at umgungundhlovo dingaan had fled with his wives and cattle leaving the circular camp of reed huts burning as a symbol of the destruction of zulu power 
on the outskirts of the capital the boers found the skeletons of retief and his men their hands and feet were still bound fast with thongs of ox hide wrote cilliers and in nearly all the corpses a spike as thick as an arm had been forced into the anus so that the point of the spike was in the chest retief who was identified by the remains of a satin vest he had worn still had a leather bag draped over his shoulder bone in it was the treaty signed by dingaan giving the boers the unoccupied land to the north according to one of the boers who saw it the treaty was astonishingly well preservedas if it had been left in a closed box pretoriuss men buried retief and his party on christmas day  
dingaan fled north but was captured by a rival tribe the swazis earlier he had persecuted the swazis and they murdered him in revenge the new zulu king mpande was officially installed in  and confirmed the contents of the treaty with the boers who established their first republic in southern africa also in  in fulfillment of their covenant the boers built a church to mark the blood river victory 
the battle of blood river entered the afrikaner psyche as a divinelyinspired victory and december  became a public holiday in south africa celebrated each year with festivals church services and reenactments the battle represented the victory of european civilization over the darkness of africa of christianity over heathens it helped justify white supremacy and the selfappointed right of afrikaners to rule over not apart from the black tribes 
yet the battle of blood river in many ways symbolized all that was wrong with the white settlement of southern africa and why that experiment failed the boers are to be praised for wanting to settle unoccupied land peacefully and for seeking the friendship of neighboring peoples but neither they nor their descendents understood that demography is the arbiter of nations those who form the majority population of a territory will rule that territory no matter how powerful a ruling elite may be they will determine its culture and society a majorityeuropean population will create a society that reflects european values and norms a majorityafrican population will create a society that reflects african norms 
the boers never understood this even at the battle of blood river they had at least  black servants and an indeterminate number of mixedrace servants who helped load weapons parker one of the scotsman had more than  black servants 
to the present day the overwhelming majority of afrikaners have black servants who work on farms in factories and in homes afrikaners failed to understand that by giving the native population the benefits of european civilization blacks would grow in numbers and overwhelm their society the cape colony and the original boer republics which were largely uninhabited by natives when they were settled by europeans are today home to tens of millions of africans 
the church of the vow built by the boers in  still stands in the town of pietermaritzburg named after piet retief but pietermaritzburg supposedly the symbol of the boer victory over the zulus is today part of a municipality called umgungundhlovo named after dingaans capital it is also the capital of the south african province of kwazulu natal and its population is more than  percent black 
the church of the vow stands alone graffitiscarred and abandoned in a dirty downtown slum its decay illustrates the fatal error made by the victors of the battle of blood river that of ignoring the demographics of race if whites had taken possession of those unoccupied lands and kept them for themselves alone the history of south africa would have been entirely different 
if the boers had inhabited and worked their own land rather than rely on black labor the states they created might still be strong and independent today their decision to use nonwhite labor was a critical error that undid all of the sacrifices of the early pioneers 
the only way to maintain a civilization is for the majority to occupy its own land with its own people and to do its own manual labor this law governs the rise and fall of civilizations and the victors of blood river ignored it to their cost"

312,"obamas attorney general warned fbi director not to inform congress of new hillary investigation   
the media is shamelessly spinning this corrupt behavior by attorney general lynch as standard protocol and blasting the fbi from deviating from some imaginary standard in which democratic presidential candidates are supposed to be immune from the consequences of their criminality  and congress is meant to be kept in the dark 
attorney general loretta lynch and deputy attorney general sally yates disagreed with fbi director james comeys decision to notify congress about his bureaus review of emails potentially related to hillary clintons personal server law enforcement officials familiar with the discussion said 
there was no direct confrontation between lynch or yates and comey instead the disagreements were conveyed to comey by justice department staff who advised the fbi chief his letter would be against department policy to not comment on investigations close to an election the officials said 
it is in line with policy though for lynch to have met with bill clinton 
but yes a hillary backer disagreed with a course of action damaging to her candidate 
comeydecided to disregard their concerns and sent the letter friday anyway shaking the presidential race  days before the election and nearly four months after the fbi chief said he wouldnt recommend criminal charges over the democratic nominees use of the server 
the officials acknowledged there was little lynch and yates could do given the fallout over lynchs controversial meeting over the summer with former president bill clinton 
note how the media is spinning this as comeys drastic course of action while lynch is just being a responsible public servant the default assumption is that comey is in the wrong for providing information to one of the major branches of government and the greater public"

sit next to elton john on a flight and youll see a man living in the lap of luxury as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip the platinumselling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear and then quickly retract it to mark the animals triumphant return he will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight  a great white shark leaping into the air 
when youre an international pop sensation worth an estimated  million people go the extra mile to make you happy flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in elton johns seatback pocket before he even boards the plane the fivetime grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying sometimes holding it a mere to inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharks beady eyes  a shark on the prowl 
rumor has it elton john first acquired this shark photo in  just before flying to london to perform candle in the wind at princess dianas funeral its been a staple of his travel routine ever since those who have flown with the music legend say that sir elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass  two hammerhead sharks 
how does the man behind tiny dancer and rocket man handle turbulence as his plane traverses the atlantic once that fasten seat belts sign lights up this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out elton john holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes often without blinking for minutes at a time  the poster for jaws

as much as elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from london to a distant corner of europe thats why all pilots who fly sir elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff so yeahits good to be elton"

republicans are so far removed from reality that sean hannity spread a fake news story on his radio show and nobody noticed the difference 
cnn reported the progression of events illustrates how fake news stories expand and spread from fringe web sites to nationally syndicated radio shows with millions of listeners in this case the fake news originated on a dubious site called your news wire which publishes a mix of true slanted and madeup news then like a game of telephone by the time the story got to hannity even the fake facts were wrong 
some rightwing websites spread the story which turned into a tall tale that added new details at each stop the fake news eventually reached the gateway pundit and to sean hannitys radio show 
after spreading the fake news to millions of listeners hannity downplayed his responsibility to get the facts right bottom line it was brought up in an insignificant way i was dealing with more important issues like hrc crimes and lies and how cnn has been colluding with the clinton campaign and cheating bernie sanders 
hannity was busy dealing with real fake issues like hillary clintons crimes and how the election is being stolen from donald trump 
how hannity put a fake story on the air is a perfect example of how the rightwing media echo chamber works nobody at any level bothered to check the facts because in the republican party belief has replaced fact conservative media knows that their audience wants confirmation of their beliefs so that is what they provide 
it doesnt matter if the confirmation is true what matters is that the audience wants it to be true 
sean hannity is pushing fake news and he doesnt care 
this is why there is such a disconnect between republicans and the rest of the country republican voters are living in a fantasy land that donald trump was able to exploit and ride the whole way to the republican nomination 
the conservative media bubble is alive and well and because of this things will get a lot worse for republicans before they begin to get better"

israels hebrewlanguage haaretz newspaper reported on friday that a total of  palestinian homes have been demolished in area c of the west bank which constitutes about  percent of the territory and is under full israeli military control since january leaving  people homeless 
that compares to  demolitions in the area last year which left  palestinians without any place of residence 
the newspaper noted that a total of  palestinian homes have also been destroyed in east jerusalem alquds since the start of the year up from  last year 
the demolitions affected  palestinians in the region marking an increase from  the previous year 
the revelations came only two days after israeli military forces razed three palestinian homes in the beit hanina and silwan neighborhoods of east jerusalem alquds displacing at least  people including minors 
international bodies and rights groups argue that israels sustained demolitions of palestinian homes and structures in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem alquds are an attempt by the tel aviv regime to uproot palestinians from their native territories and confiscate more land for expansion of illegal settlements 
more than half a million israelis live in over  illegal settlements built since the  israeli occupation of the palestinian territories of the west bank and east jerusalem alquds 
the presence and continued expansion of israeli settlements in occupied palestinian lands have created a major obstacle for the efforts to establish peace in the middle east

smith currently vice president and general counsel at enstar natural gas co in alaska said she decided to speak out after hearing republican presidential nominee donald trumps lewd comments about women 
a  video was released earlier this month by the washington post in which trump can be heard making lewd comments about women and bragging about groping them 
a number of women have since come forward claiming that the business mogul has sexually assaulted them

if skies are clear the upcoming full moon will appear up to  percent bigger and  percent brighter than usual according to nasa this image shows a near full moon in aravica arizona on october   photo by afp 
the moons distance from earth varies because it is in an eggshaped not circular orbit around the planet 
since the moons orbit is elliptical one side perigee is about  kilometers closer to earth than the other apogee 
the word syzygy is the scientific term used for when the earth sun and moon line up as the moon orbits earth 
when perigeesyzygy of the earthmoonsun system occurs and the moon is on the opposite side of the earth from the sun we get a perigee moon which is more commonly known as supermoon

334,"a tenperson federal jury has found that rolling stone journalist sabrina rubin erdely defamed university of virginia dean nicole eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking  million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley  in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade
the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in  centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley  well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for  million  a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical
sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later
because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone  and wenner media for the  million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts
aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women
the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture
nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual
after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police
again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath
jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own
because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations
if nicole eramo gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim
determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding
other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess
lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone  and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men

donald trumps campaign debuted a dark new attack ad on tuesday looking to further its portrayal of hillary clinton as a corrupt politician and doubling down on allegations that she grew wealthy through paytoplay politicsthe tv spot hits clinton the democratic presidential nominee on controversies related to her familys foundation stating that staggering amounts of cash poured into the clinton foundation from criminals dictators countries that hate america and that hillary cut deals for donors 
clintons charitable foundation has faced intense scrutiny this election over concerns about possible conflicts of interest because it took in money from corporations and foreign governments clinton has repeatedly denied however that her work as secretary of state was compromised by the foundations work or that she gave any special privileges to its donorsthe clintons have also said that the foundation which contributes to aids relief abroad among other charitable causes will cease taking money from corporations and foreign governments if she is elected presidentstill the ad from the republican nominee claims that clinton sold out american workers exploited haitians in need she even gave american uranium rights to the russianshillary clinton only cares about power money and herself its voice over concludesthe advertisement is another instance of trump an embattled candidate in an already divisive race going on the offensive as the presidential campaign enters its final weeks as trump trails in the polls and highprofile republicans abandon him he has attacked clinton and her husbands character going so far as to bring women who had accused bill clinton of sexual misconduct to watch the second debate in st louis last weekendsome republicans had called for him to drop out of the race after a  recording emerged showing him bragging about sexual assault last week but attacking even republican establishment figures like speaker paul ryan and arizona sen john mccain trump has promised to plow forward and some observers suggest he has little to loseit is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and i can now fight for america the way i want to he tweeted on tuesday"

a trump supporter sporting a hillary for prison tshirt chanted jews sa in support of his candidate during a rally in arizona on saturday 
the target was the pen of reporters who have been fodder for trumps rhetoric at every rally 
the context while the crowd was chanting usa one man chanted jews sa words like that cant be spun or read into the intent and meaning were obvious to everyone 
watch here on video obtained by the huffington post  
this sort of thing comes as no surprise considering that donald trump spent the last year spewing hate filled venom in every possible direction it may seem superfluous to restate every category of people for which trump has shown contempt but it is not 
muslims jews immigrants labor taxpayers latinos hispanics mexicans africanamericans women pows veterans people with disabilities gold star families and the military have felt the sting of trumps words and the disdain in his heart 
throughout this campaign season the vitriol against hillary clinton saw no limit signs and tshirts too disgusting to quote in this article chants of lock her up at the republican convention and since trump promised his base of thugs lowlifes and haters he would weaken the first amendment strengthen the second and establish the altright utopia 
hillary clinton was already the most qualified candidate in this race she also proved to have more stamina than any previous candidate needed not only was she competing against a vicious and pathological liar she was competing for who we are and who we could be for all the trump claims that the media is rigged in clintons favor it was trump who got free advertising who framed the narrative and whose words were the primary news stories of the campaign 
there is no doubt that hillary clinton will keep her promise to fight for us she has been doing it from the beginning of this campaign every time hillary clinton called out donald trumps sexist comments she was fighting for all women who were attacked humiliated and sexually abused by men like trump every time clinton shamed trumps horrific and disgusting comments about the khan family she was standing up for every gold star family she was also standing up for every muslimamerican the same is true every time clinton condemned trump for mocking a disabled reporter or resorted to altright stereotypes about africanamericans innercities and africanamerican communities 
every time trump spewed hate in whatever direction hillary clinton defended the target 
so no this isnt about choosing the lesser of two evils like every election this is about choosing our next president more importantly its about voting for who we are and who we aspire to be

as if the election of donald trump couldnt get even more disastrous and hypocritical senator lindsey graham just called on trump to nominate a rightwing extremist to nations highest court 
all year long republicans have been blocking president obamas nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court because they want the next president to make the pick and because they now have the conservative puppet president they have always wanted they want to make sure that nominee is a conservative extremist 
south carolina senator lindsey graham told wyfftv that trump should pick texas senator ted cruz as the nominee and warned democrats not to block him which is hypocritical considering how republicans have treated president obamas nominee and threatened to block any nominees hillary clinton would have made had she won the election 
im here to tell my democratic colleagues that i voted for obamas nominees i expect them to give trumps nominees a fair shake he won this election he will pick a conservative i would put ted cruz on that list if they try to block this pick they will regret it if you dont honor trumps nominee youre making a huge mistake 
democrats should stand up and give graham a collective middle finger 
since antonin scalia died in february there has been a vacancy on the supreme court bench that has yet to be filled the body wasnt even cold yet before republicans vowed to block any nominee president obama picked to replace him going so far as to even deny garland a confirmation hearing thats far from the fair shake graham is asking democrats to give to a man as dangerous as ted cruz 
putting cruz on the supreme court would guarantee rulings against womens rights and lgbt rights as well as putting laws like the voting rights act and the civil rights act in further peril in no uncertain terms should democrats grant cruz a hearing nor should they respect any of trumps conservative choices for the court republicans should have thought about fair shakes before taking the totally unprecedented step of being complete assholes toward the supreme court nominee of a sitting president who also won an election and s far more popular than trump again senate republicans didnt even give garland a hearing or a vote they refused to do their jobs entirely out of disrespect towards president obama and so thats exactly what democrats should do to trump turnabout is fair play and republicans only have themselves to blame

with protests erupting across the country this week and emotions running high american companies are trying to make sense of how to react to a trump presidential election win but one major company has clearly made up its mind and just came down squarely in the antitrump camp in a big way donald trump will be added to disneys hall of presidents but his animatronic figure will be able to feel pain 
wow disney just showed that it does not pull punches when it comes to what the company believes in check out the press release they put out this morning 
disney prides itself on promoting inclusivity empathy and nonviolence which are values that mr trumps presidency threatens thats why when we eventually add him to our hall of presidents exhibit in disney worlds magic kingdom his mechanical replica will bear the capacity to suffer horribly and without limit being a company that caters to diverse families we felt it was a moral responsibility to have mr trumps robotic counterpart be receptive to extreme thirst and burning sensations while also being wired with the knowledge that it can never receive the sweet mercy of death this is the best way for us to uphold the hall of presidents tradition while also voicing our vigorous objection to the trump administration 
given that disneys software makes the animatronic believe its bones are shattering each time it moves or speaks this company clearly wants people to know its not onboard the trump train 
park visitors who feel similarly opposed to trumps presidency can rest assured that his hall of presidents double will be designed to experience anxiety so its always aware that more pain is coming although the machine will understand what joy is its programming will never allow it to feel that 
and disneys not letting trump off the hook there the replicas for abraham lincoln and george washington will even be reprogrammed to slap scratch and pry the fingernails off the animatronic trump which will respond to such painful stimuli by gasping crying screaming vomiting or a mix of all of these 
if that doesnt send a powerful statement about where disney stands politically we dont know what does 
its safe to say we wont see the trumps vacationing there anytime soon dont share disneys disdain for a trump presidency you may be better off heading to space mountain instead of the hall of presidents because disney has officially drawn the battle line right there"

348,"home this month popular  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women david g brown 
david is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   girls 
forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses 
of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man 
so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women  fighting for them 
i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes captainsaveaho who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested 
in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the white knight invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr white knight and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion  fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants 
this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working 
remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed 
at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped 
in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity  paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships 
unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals 
in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less 
when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially  shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself 
unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established 
on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot 
your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have  hours a day  days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women  moving to them for them sucker 
this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl 
perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them 
snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution 
so whats just as bad as an entitled woman a man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation"

these days it has most certainly become chic for the modern liberal to throw about accusations of racism although this type of racebaiting has been going on for a number of years now it became more noticeable during the  us presidential election when these liberals accuse donald trump of being racist they had better be careful for one specific reason 
a leaked video from  shows that during president obama s first campaign he was also concerned about border security and he even suggested a wall now there is just one dominant question anti trump individuals need to digest 
is obama a racist too because he was talking about some things you could easily accuse trump of lets play a quick game if you didnt know who said this would you think it was donald trump in  or barack obama in  
this mans core goal was to preserve the integrity of our borders to reduce illegal immigration does this sound like trump or obama  
how about this one this man said additional fencing could help get our border under control definitely sounds more like a gop candidate than a democrat one thats for sure 
finally this man also supported additional personnel infrastructure and technology on our border and at ports of entry liberals would love to claim these quotes came from donald j trump  especially considering he is the villain du jour in their lives at the moment 
i hate to steal their thunder but these quotes did indeed come from a young barack obama in  even he understood the need for a controlled border before the special interests in this country got to him 
so it is one thing when leaked videos show hillary clinton believed border security was important it was entirely another when they showed that her husband thought it was important but when liberal idol barack obama says it say it isnt so liberals just cant handle that 
but anyway folks it is all about platforms im sure you have learned by now that donald trump doesnt get the free pass other politicians in this country enjoy first of all he is a conservative so he is already someone every liberal loves to hate 
republicans have been so badly demonized in this country simply for desiring to get it under control luckily people saw through the propaganda and decided that obama s brand was simply not working any longer 
people are fed up with politicians who say one thing and do another if you are looking for a reason why donald trump is the new president and not hillary clinton there you go"

351,"christie lost republicans the  election he may be losing them the  election too by ben shapiro november   
ambition can be dangerous not just for the ambitious man or woman but for the country  for all those who ally with the ambitious person 
for the last eight years one of the most ambitious men in politics has been new jersey governor chris christie hailed as a conservative darling after taking on teachers unions in new jersey  brash language about punching them in the face marked his rise as a political force and an upandcomer in presidential politics  christie has nearly singlehandedly destroyed the republican party in two straight presidential elections 
in  christie was considered and rejected for vice president by mitt romney  but then gave the keynote speech in primetime at the republican convention there he spent the bulk of his time talking about his own wonders ignoring romney completely fox news chris wallace called the speech the most curious keynote speech i have ever heardfor a moment i forgot who was the nominee of the party 
then the week before the election hurricane sandy hit the east coast while new york governor andrew cuomo told president obama that his presence was unnecessary christie invited obama to new jersey then hugged him and took him on a tour of atlantic city where they made political love along the boardwalk underneath the cloudy skies i cannot thank the president enough for his personal concern and compassion for our state christie said adding that it was my honor to introduce president obama christie was at the time facing down rumors that thennewark mayor corey booker who is black would run against him as the new york times noted the scene played out on televisions around the country like a stirring campaign ad that hit themes of bipartisanship and crisis management  only it was run free of charge 
obama surged in the final days and beat romney handily 
fast forward three years 
christie was running in the republican primaries hed done nothing much in the polls his only hope was to somehow do well in new hampshire he had no support in states like south carolina or nevada or southern states dominated by support for donald trump ted cruz and marco rubio so naturally he used his presence at the debate before the new hampshire primary  a state in which rubio was surging following his iowa showing  to destroy rubio christie rightly labeled rubio a robotic candidate rubio repeated himself christie hit him again  and rubio fell apart in the polling trump ran away with the state almost immediately christie quit the race and fell in behind trump thanks in large part to christies help trump won the nomination 
now with trump surging in the polls the week before his general election against hillary clinton christie has struck again this time two of his top aides have been found guilty on all charges related to bridgegate the scandal in which the christie administration allegedly blocked bridges in order to punish a local democrat who wouldnt endorse christies reelection bid  this story will allow the media to shift its focus to the trump campaign since christie is leader of trumps white house transition team in a tight election it could be enough to hand hillary the white house 
so thanks chris christie

the th woman has come forward to accuse donald trump of doing what he bragged about doing on the billy bush bus tape 
in a story that sounds very familiar former miss finland ninni laaksonen told the tabloid iltasanomat that the now republican nominee grabbed her butt just before trump and three other beauty pageant contests went on the air for the late show with david letterman in  
before the show we were photographed outside the building laaksonen is quoted by haaretz  trump stood next to me and suddenly he squeezed my butt he really grabbed my butt i dont think anybody saw it but i flinched and thought what is happening 
as to the veracity of these claims it should be noted that laaksonen didnt seek the tabloid out iltasanomat the second largest paper in the country according to wikipedia  reached out to finnish women who had encountered trump and thats how they discovered her story 
in case youre not already grimacing the former miss finland added somebody told me there that trump liked me because i looked like melania when she was younger 
trump has been caught on tape saying women expire at the age of  melania trump is now  so she would have been expired when this alleged groping incident took place in  
new york magazine has an exhaustive list of allegations made by women against donald trump 
donald trump is on tape bragging about grabbing women by their pssy against their will so its not a stretch to hear that he did indeed do this to women who are also willing to come forward and face the wrath of the trump machine 
what should be alarming is that donald trump is the best of the best on the republican bench i mean that is supposed to be how this works right a group of top contenders are picked for possible nomination and the best gets it 
republicans try to say this is just locker room talk but if then senator barack obama had had a bus tape like trumps let alone  women accusing him of doing what he bragged about doing he not only wouldnt be in office right now  he wouldnt have been a contender rightfully so"

an important question is on the  election statewide ballot in massachusetts question  deals with the states charter school cap without the cap upwards of  charter schools could be approved by the state district in the next fiscal year the charter school scam has spread its tentacles into the state ofmassachusetts in large part due to the obama administration a vote no is thus critical toward halting the march of privatization in the education system occurring nationwide as massachusetts residents gear up to vote for the next president of the united states it is important to remember that the transformation of public education into a private good will not cease as long as popular opposition fails to confront its roots in washington
the obama administration immediately created the race to the top program after the  election this program paved a direct path toward the elimination of public education as we know it the department of education funneled billions of us dollars into incentive schemes to privatize public schools district by district federal funds were dangled in front of mostly poor mostly black cities as long as these districts met the mandates of the program these mandates included the closure of failing schools mergers with forprofit charter schools and the complete transformation of public schools into charter laboratories race to the top created favorable conditions for private capitalists to engulf the entire us public education system
the results have been disastrous hundreds of public schools have closed around the country tens of thousands of public school teachers have been fired in new orleans nearly every school operating in the district is a privately owned by  publicly funded charter schools the chicago teachers union recently averted a strike but has been dealing with the consequences of the closure of fifty schools in the city in  
the impact of charter schools has extended beyond teacher layoffs and school closures charter schools have also promoted segregation based on race and class the civil rights project of ucla has found that seventy percent of black charter school students attend intensely segregated charter schools  furthermore charter schools also demand an even more intense policy of standardized testing withcurriculums that are often guided by the test corporations themselves all the while these institutions have found ample time to discriminate against els and disabled students
in addition charter schools have been found to cheat students from a quality education charter schools are even more militarized than traditional public schools and sport higher rates of suspension and expulsion rates corporate charter operators also cream students from the top and toss the rest even so charters have not proven to do any better than public schools in terms of test scores  what the charter school movement does possess is the backing of the elite which has masterfully used media and nonprofit manipulation to demonize public education
the usual capitalist players have been the primary leaders in the drive to rid of the charter school cap in massachusetts the new york lobbying group families for excellent schools is controlled by hedge fund managers whose funds stem from donations from the walton family ie walmart another organization education reform now advocacy has received upwards of  million dollars from the same source  charter schools are often labeled public because they receive tax payer dollars however the schools are accountable to no one except the corporate interests that back them
a yes vote on question two would place the education of students in massachusetts firmly in the hands of the kingpins of privatization not only would twelve charter schools per year be subject to approval but fortyfive public schools would be in danger of closure over  million more dollars per year would be siphoned from public schools across the state at the moment the charter school cap allows the state to operate no more than  charter schools if the cap islifted however this restriction would no longer apply and leave the students families and educatorsvictimto the shock and awe privatization which has characterized national policy for over two decades
opposition to privatization is being led by the organization save our schools save our schools consists of families teachers students and unions that are looking to prevent an era of unbridled privatization in the massachusetts public education system charter schools already drain  million from public education in the stateeach year as it currently stands a vote no would protect public schools and thus the unions that representtheir educators
a no vote would build upon numerous labor victories in the massachusetts area over the last few years the boston school bus drivers union local  won a historic victory against the veolia corporation in  the harvard dining workers of local  unite here followed by defeating harvards bid to raise healthcare costs in october of  now it is time to stand with teachers across the state in their effort to prevent fullscale privatization
doing so will not be easy the model of unionmanagement cooperationwith thedemocratic party continues to prevent workers in massachusetts and across the country from taking offensive action against the privatization assault a vote no on question  in massachusetts would show that community and union members can organize a successful pushback against the forces behind privatization however a vision of transformation and radical change must be articulated if defense of public education is to materialize into a peoples movement the fight against privatization must be placed in the contextof the larger struggle to build a world that working and oppressed people would vote yes to"

book review  dr rafiq islam emertec rd ltd dalhousie university halifax nova scotia
 book title true islam jihad and terrorism the science of islamic foreign policy  jaan s islam
 publisher new york nova science publishers
 isbn 
 at a time of politics of fear jaan islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece true islam jihad and terrorism nova science publishers new york  during the  us election it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of islam and how it is understood in todays context this is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about islamic history philosophy and political science this book presents the islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great muslim thinkers and scholars such as ibn khaldun jaan islam uses the socalled islamic cognition technique and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to islamic cognition this chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields such an extension was first pointed by islam zatzman and islam  in their groundbreaking work on educational curriculum
more stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of modern imperialism another ramadan for muslims amid sufferings a conversation on equality integration and islam as a religious marker an open letter to young muslims everywhere the seed of triumph in every adversity following the tradition of early islamic scholars jaan islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary islamic sources quran and authenticated traditions of the prophet  these sources were completely ignored in the in the orientalist now it has morphed into neoorientalism writings which led to the inundation of the post  world with disinformation and agendadriven research about islamic history the distinction between this book and these agendadriven ones gives the book a special value
 although the book explains the islamic foundations of political science and governance it should not be looked at as a book of theology it is a dogmafree approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere  quite appropriately the author starts off with a brilliant narration of islamic cognition it has been all but forgotten in the west that islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogmafree truly scientific cognition the west does recognize averröes the famous islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy whereas brands islam as just another religion similar to christianity infected with doctrinal philosophy it is no surprise that with that starting point islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west
chapter  of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers namely hobbes locke and ibn khaldun in this chapter the author debunks another myth that is ibn khalduns political theory is somehow similar to those of hobbes and locke ibn khaldun the father of social science indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition the author points out how ibn khalduns first premise was shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using quran as the origin and prophet muhammads life through the book of hadith as the pivotal point one the other hand locke had placed himself as the pivotal point whereas hobbes eliminated any cognition point the author makes it clear that both hobbes and lockes cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition in my researched opinion this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic it is because the eastern authors do not know about hobbes and locke and the western authors do not know about islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with ibn khaldun
in chapter  the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs known as rashedun caliphs clearly the authors intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the quran they were enacting for the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the quran no other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in this finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young islamic state of the time
similar to chapter  the author discovers jus ad bello in islamic jurisprudence in chapter  once again the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not the theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter
in chapter  the author addresses a difficult topic when is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state it is often stated that islam is a complete code of life the author makes it clear that islam didnt leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time the important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary this is not an easy topic to cover even in todays world the author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary the history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided caliphate the victors were no longer rightly guided the author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership this chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of islam that has spent lifetime on the topic
often when islamic criteria are discussed eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief if it is all that simple why dont islamic scholars have consensus the author handles this topic like a pro in chapter  he analyzes current islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process he has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the selfrighteous apologist scholars that have done great disservice to islam andor scientific cognition process one doesnt have to be personal but the writing is so clear one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars to anyones surprise this list is not made out of antiislamic nonmuslim scholars
chapter  is where proof of the pudding appears the author analyzes every major event of todays political arena and analyzes it with the islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum the author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups most interesting is the discussion on current us allies such as saudi arabia and how they rank among the biggest offenders of islam and islamic laws this is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable punctuated with numerous riveting arguments
chapter  is the conclusion and recommendation i have studied islam for some  years and yet i found these conclusions novel and entirely logical i doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion it is important to read the book in sequence
chapter  lists the bibliography and references it is many pages long and is quite comprehensive
chapter  is the appendix that lists the letters of the prophet it is a great idea to give the letters in original arabic so there is no room for misinterpretation let alone disinformation
anyone with knowledge of islam knows that jihad is in the core of islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology quite interestingly the author even depicts jihad as the roof of islam without the roof the fort of islam has no protection whatsoever this depiction captures the essence of protection security as well as integrity and puts away the notion of jihad being a weapon for crusade like aggression
this book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about islam or what islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word islam that means peace through submission to the creator this book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todays world in this sense this book is a manual for world governance in peace"
358,"richard w painter wrote in a new york times an oped the fbis job is to investigate not to influence the outcome of an election 
such acts could also be prohibited under the hatch act which bars the use of an official position to influence an election that is why the fbi presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the election the usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment 
and that is why on saturday i filed a complaint against the fbi with the office of special counsel which investigates hatch act violations and with the office of government ethics i have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george w bush and i never thought that the fbi could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations until this week 
this is the second complaint to be filed against fbi director comey the democratic coalition against trump has also filed a complaint against comey for interfering in a presidential election as a federal employee 
suspicion around comeys actions has grown as the fbi director is not expected to make any additional statements on this matter before the presidential election director comey appears to have set himself for problems after the election as senate democrats are making it known that they are open to holding hearings to investigate the fbi investigation if they win back the senate majority 
unless trump wins and republicans take control of congress director comey is going to have to answer for his decisions 
as the complaints pile up it looks like congressional testimony may be the least of james comeys future problems"

casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the chinese 
with their affinity for baccarat the most lucrative game in las vegas chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment  be it with private chinese gaming salons lunar new year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from hong kong and taiwan 
no one in las vegas however has built a casino and hotel strictly for chinese visitors until now 
the lucky dragon hotel  casino is billing itself as las vegas first asianthemed resort funded in large part by chinese investors the property set to open dec  with a traditional lion dance will offer bilingual staff and signage a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldnt look or taste out of place in guangzhou or shanghai 
no general tsos or egg rolls here said david jacoby chief operating officer for the resort which left no chinese superstition unturned 
the rosecolored resorts front entrance is designed in a dragon motif a feng shui master blessed its kitchens the main bar is eightsided for good fortune and its hard to find a no  on the property the unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory the ninestory hotel even skips a fourth floor 
this place is heavily feng shuied jacoby said 
with all that attention to detail youd think lucky dragons brain trust was born in beijing but the idea behind the room boutique resort off the northern end of the las vegas strip was largely conceived by an american veteran gaming executive bill weidner the former president and chief operating officer of las vegas sands corp 
weidner an advisor to lucky dragon is no neophyte to the chinese market he worked with some of chinas most powerful government figures to lead sands expansion into macau when the former portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in  macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the las vegas strip forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry 
weidner was also involved in the development of the billion marina bay sands in singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in  
weidner and jacoby know major las vegas gaming resorts like the sands venetian mgm or wynn already cater to chinas high rollers with vip parlors and relationships forged in macau 
lucky dragon though tiny compared with those properties addresses what they see as a gap in the market middleclass chinese gamblers chinese americans as well as the broader asian american community 
let them fight over the  and let us fight over the remaining  said jacoby who previously worked for weidners firm global gaming asset management opening a casino resort in the philippines 
that pool of chinese gamers will almost certainly grow on dec  hainan airlines will fly the first direct flights from china to las vegass mccarran international airport lucky dragon guests are confirmed to be on that flight jacoby said 
already a record  visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in  according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority 
meanwhile ground was broken on another asianthemed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to  billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in  
plans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business 
its going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with  rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size isaac brekken  for the times 
competition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anticorruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a twoyear slump 
las vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about  billion in  thats nearly  billion less than  according to the nevada gaming control board 
the casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck 
the vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon 
jacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a secondfloor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum 
food is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others 
las vegas has a number of wellregarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel  casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine highend chinese food is also served at highroller rooms such as the venetians paiza club 
no casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat  and gamble  at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip 
the emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to chinese tourists like a whiskey bar or nightclub and because chinese tourists often dont like to sunbathe lucky dragons pool isnt much bigger than the backyard variety 
jacoby says his competitors on the strip offer chinese gamers a diluted experience by operating a handful of chinese restaurants and parlors in megacasinos that have to serve all manner of people not just chinese by comparison visitors to lucky dragon can start conversing in mandarin with staff as soon as they walk in he said 
were trying to take the asian gaming experience and bring that front and center instead of hiding the most valuable customer in a segregated portion of a large building jacoby said 
though lucky dragon will rely heavily on asian american customers at first its funding was largely drawn from mainland chinese investors through the federal eb visa program the visa allows foreigners and their immediate family to gain permanent us residency in exchange for a minimum investment of  that also creates american jobs rather than focusing on bars and nightclubs the casino is prioritizing dining options that includes a tea room still under construction isaac brekken  for the times 
chinese investors have dominated the program nationwide accounting for  of applicants awaiting eb visas though occasionally subject to fraud the program has successfully funded a handful of mixedused projects in new york the jw marriott hotel at la live and the sls hotel  casino across from lucky dragon 
jacoby declined to say how many chinese investors are involved in lucky dragon which is expected to employ  people jacoby also declined to disclose how much the project cost adding that earlier media reports pegging the price tag at about  million were inaccurate 
the company hit a snag last year when it unsuccessfully sought tax subsidies from the city but financial commitments from weidners family and others put the project back on track 
lucky dragon isnt the first las vegas resort to target a specific demographic the hard rock hotel  casino and the palms casino resort opened years ago catering to young partygoers and clubbers before eventually being overshadowed by larger competitors on the strip such as the mgm grand and the cosmopolitan 
lucky dragons early backers even considered building an lgbt resort before settling on their current strategy one they say will live and die on being able to deliver an authentic chinese gambling experience 
we set out trying to put together a place that would stand alone in shanghai if you dropped it off down there today jacoby said we didnt want to have just gongs asian tapestries and caricaturestuff like that"

donated millions to her clinton foundation if you arent aware of this you need to watch clinton cash immediately  the simple truth is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel what america has now come to realize via the wikileaks email dumps  the project veritas undercover videos and even the revelations of former fbi agents who know whats really happening inside the agency is that the entire democrat party is a massive criminal cartel from the dnc which actively conspired to sideline bernie sanders during the nomination process to the leftwing media which coordinates false

364,"is deindustrialization a natural phenomenon of developed economies increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices jörg guido hülsmann  misesorg   
let me first state my position and then add a few arguments to back it up 
economic growth typically entails a reallocation of labor away from industrial production but it does not all by itself lead to falling industrial output the decline of industrial production in the us and france in the past thirty years is to some extent due to capital exports but especially to government interventionism in the form of mushrooming labor business and financial regulations education policies social security funding and taxation this decline cannot be stopped through more interventions even if they are designed with the good intention to reindustrialize the country 
now let me offer a few considerations in support of these contentions 
the reallocation of labor in a growing economy results most notably from capital accumulation and from changing preferences of the workingage population further investments and extensions of the existing structure of production make it necessary to spend more time devising new methods preparing industrial activity coordinating and monitoring supply chains lowquality bluecollar labor diminishes whereas there is some increase in highquality bluecollars but especially an increase in whitecollars working in and around the supply chains 
increasing real revenues affect peoples lifestyle choices rather than laboring long hours that provide essentially a monetary reward they increasingly prefer enjoyable activities that provide immediate psychological and emotional rewards thus the blossoming of artistic intellectual and scientific activities in developed countries at the expense of traditional industrial pursuits 
as a natural consequence of economic growth therefore industrial production declines relative to what it could be if it attracted even more people but this does neither imply a shrinking physical industrial output nor does it imply shrinking industrial revenues capital accumulation and technological progress make it possible that industry thrives even when less people have industrial employment germany provides an example 
in the past thirty years western capitalists have invested large amounts of capital in formerly communist countries of the east and far east this reallocation of capital though beneficial from the overall point of view of the world economy has been detrimental in the shortrun to the industrial development of those western countries where the capital would otherwise have been used 
but capital investments in countries such as france and the us have declined even more as a result of mushrooming government interventions welfare checks diminish the incentive to accept lowpaying and nongratifying industrial jobs massive subsidies for secondary and higher education artificially prolong schooling reduce the supply of qualified manual labor and create an artificial bias among the workingage population for scientific intellectual and artistic activities panoply of regulations have on the one hand increased the costs of doing business and on the other hand stimulated rentseeking and manifold forms of evasion and regulatory arbitrage today they are feeding entire armies of lawyers accountants auditors and financial advisors all at the expense of ordinary business 
these tendencies cannot be stopped through socalled reindustrialization policies which boil down to even more government spending premised on the spurious notion that irresponsible and often also inexperienced politicians know best how to use the available scarce resources such policies have utterly failed in the past airbus included and will fail in the future genuine reindustrialization requires more oxygen for industry it requires nothing less than a rollback of the artificial obstacles for industrial development that government interventions have created in past generations"

367,"obama votes against us at un october   daniel greenfield 
obamas abstention from a un vote against the us is a new low for the most antiamerican administration in american history under obama our foreign policy has been reoriented toward damaging our own interests as much as possible but actively opposing us policy at the un is a new low 
the resolution ares is on the necessity of ending the economic commercial and financial embargo imposed by the united states of america against cuba 
it was introduced at the request of cuba back in  with a memorandum that accused america of pursuing an aggressive policy against cuba with the declared aim of imposing on it the political social and economic order which the united states authorities consider most fitting this policy has included direct military intervention the threat of nuclear annihilation the instigation and carrying out of countless acts of sabotage and plans to assassinate cuban leaders 
as obamas creepy toady ben rhodes tweeted no reason to vote to defend a failed policy we oppose 
except the failed policy is that of the united states by we rhodes means that obama and the left arent going to defend the united states in international forums when they disagree with the us 
all this is yet another reminder that the people running the country are not of the country theyre a hostile foreign ideology that sees itself as separate from the united states and does not believe it has any responsibilities toward the united states 
at the un samantha power took the antiamerican positions to applause from a un united with obama against america 
for more than  years the united states had a policy aimed at isolating the government of cuba for roughly half of those years un member states have voted overwhelmingly for a general assembly resolution that condemns the us embargo and calls for it to be ended the united states has always voted against this resolution today the united states will abstain applause thank you

one of norways nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine monday morning according to the norwegian radiation protection authority nrpa  
in a statement released today the nrpa said 
the radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall emissions are low 
experts say contamination levels around the institute for energy technology in the southern town of halden were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public 
said per strand deputy directorgeneral at the nrpa a government regulator 
of course its an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk this is not the sort of leak we want  
the radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility 
staff were evacuated from the institute but later returned donning protective gear to assess the cause and extent of the leak and halt it 
a senior nrpa official said the incident would maybe be rated a  on the international nuclear event scale which rates nuclear incidents from  to  by comparison the incidents at fukishima and chernobyl were ranked   source the government of the hong kong special administrative region 
regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today  atle valseth a research director at the institute for energy technology agreed he said 
i dont sit so close to those decisions but i think we should have informed the authority yesterday we will have to go through why it wasnt reported  it wasnt good enough that we didnt report it yesterday  
strand the head of safety preparedness and environment at the nrpa expressed the regulators frustration 
we need to gather more information  but we are not happy with the situation that we were not warned immediately we will investigate further  
the swiss radiation safety authority srsa said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility which sits close to the swiss border 
mark foreman a nuclear expert at the chalmers university of technology in sweden stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel which is contained within a ceramic material the ceramicwrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut the tube is inside the reactor 
the iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall

369,"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

the fbi investigation spread like wildfire last night this is the result of the press once again taking republican smoke and claiming theres fire 
this observation isnt mine along the washington posts greg sargent pointed out that there is only an upside and no penalty for doing this  for both republicans and the press this is how gop hypeaheadofthefacts gets rewarded by medias willful perpetuation of smokefire effect zero penalty only upside httpstcovmzltracl 
 greg sargent theplumlinegs october   
even though early polling shows there hasnt been an impact in swing states  and even though the majority of americans have already made up their minds each time her emails are brought up hillary clinton falls in the polls 
a gallup poll showed that emails are the most americans have heard about clinton not that she is the most qualified candidate in modern history or how her policy on paid family leave might impact them  but the emails that she was already cleared on 
even though one result of the comey letter has been to energize clinton supporters  at a time when she was facing a likely win that can create complacency this still isnt an acceptable practice 
republican fbi director james comey finds himself in the hot seat today after sending a letter that has no precedent obviously would impact an election that was then just  days out and is now  days out and actually bore no information well thats inaccurate the letter bore inaccurate smoke and innuendo that has already been cleared but the damage has already been done 
while ron fournier and others suggested that democratic objections to this unprecedented violation of the rules by comey was just more partisan folly the truth is even more disturbing 
by even suggesting that objecting to violating a longstanding rule is partisan we are allowing the press to enable republicans to continue pretending there is no reality 
in reality no matter which side of the aisle you are on its a rule not to comment on ongoing investigations that could impact an election the reasons for this are obvious and the potential ramifications for abuse are terrifying for both parties  for instance its obvious that the fbi is investigating the trump campaign for coordination with russia but we dont headline that because the fbi hasnt commented on that because 
to do so would violate the rule not to interfere with elections 
so its really quite frightening to hear people claim objecting to violating this rule is partisan even as the trump campaign is benefiting from the adherence to said rule if the rule applies to donald trump it should apply to hillary clinton 
asking that this value be applied to both sides is not partisan 
we must stick to reality we must not allow our need to appear objective cause us to fall so far down the rabbit hole that we enable republicans to keep drinking the nofact koolaid 
the press did the republican smoke is a real fire thing all through president obamas terms at one point claiming he was implicated in benghazi emails because a reporter allowed a republican aide to read him said emails  and of course it turned out that the emails didnt say what the aide told the reporter but that was learned much later and as everyone knows a lie travels faster than the truth 
and now american voters in swing states who read papers will think the fbi is investigating clinton 
so comeys letter did damage hillary clinton even if she wins the election the letter damaged her and down ballot democrats 
the media never learns they take republican smoke and innuendo and treat it as fact every time they look like fools to those who know there was no there in the comey letter but the average voter doesnt live for political updates 
the irresponsible damage is done

john key channels nz taxpeyers money to clinton foundation 


this is information that every taxpayer or those that care should know about but our journalists are not doing their job  

what with warships in our harbour and troops in iraq this government of john key is in lockstep with the most corrupt and warmongering part of the us government 

no doubt key would approve of the clintons defrauding the people of haiti its his style 

the cannabis party is calling on john key to explain why he gave over  million of new zealand taxpayers money to the clinton foundation  

legalise cannibis party 

 october  

wikileaks raised serious ethical concerns about the clinton foundation when it published a hacked email send to clinton campaign chairman john podesta revealing blurred lines between the foundation and the personal financial interests of bill and hillary clinton 

cannabis party leader julian crawford said if john key was serious about hiv prevention one of the clinton foundations supposed goals he should legalise medical cannabis in new zealand 

hundreds of researchers have reported that thc was able to destroy the riv virus in monkeys that virus is nearly identical to the hiv virus found in humans he said 

john key has a lot of explaining to do if the wikileaks revelations about the clinton foundation are true 

former assistant director of the fbi thomas fuentes confirmed that the fbi has an intensive investigation ongoing into the clinton foundation 

new zealands national business review has reported that john key will continue giving millions of dollars of taxpayers money to the foundation in the future despite the criminal investigation of hillary clinton 

ive met her on lots of occasions had dinner with her at premier house a few times john key said 

as secretary of state she was great very engaged with new zealand broadcaster duncan garner yesterday raised serious concerns about the ongoing payments to the clinton foundation known as paytoplay 

we also give money to the clinton foundation yes we did gosh who didnt get a handout garner said 

weve been feeding all these guys at the trough for years 

paytoplay refers to operations where bill and hillary clinton rewarded big donors to their foundation with preferential access to the us government 

the original article was in the neoliberal nbr behind a paywall

one of the major reasons why lots of people choose organic foods is to avoid exposure to chemicals however most of these organic foods such as beans  often come in packaging which if not done well there are lots of chemicals present that can greatly interfere with the normal physiology especially if there is a wrong choice of packaging company 
various types of food packaging can possibly leach compounds into your food investigate your packaging kitchen and youll observe a lot of materials to be concerned about regardless of the possibility that youre for the most part a real food type of individual you presumably have canned merchandise oats pastas and granola bars packaged in plastic bags plastic wrap and plastic storage in your washroom 
most by far of food and refreshment cans which seem by all accounts to be made of metals like steel and aluminum in reality are lined with bpa bps or deplorable substitutes like polyvinyl chloride pvc which contains the known cancercausing agent vinyl chloride your canned soup soda significantly seltzer or juices are likely exposing you to bpa and different compounds youre in an ideal situation not ingesting 
even packaging made of evidently amiable paper might be lined with chemicals of concern like pfass which can be found in pizza boxes and the wrapping of slick takeout food extra chemicals from flame retardants to bpa have worked their way into our paper packaging as laudable efforts to recycle paper have presented a variety of different contaminants 
the environmental working group ewg has added yet another database to its arsenal of chemical data for consumers permitting the individuals who need to avoid exposure to toxins to check for bpa in their food packaging they built up the database since they contend that consumers have a right to recognize whats in their food  particularly with regards to an ingredient for example bpa that has been linked to cancer infertility mind nervous system and cardiovascular abnormalities diabetes obesity and different genuine disorders theres no simple route for your average consumer to discover what their food is stuffed in and little research demonstrating the amount of these chemicals migrate into our food 
a wholefood unpackaged eating regimen is your best safeguard against the chemicals in packaging also it is very important to check the reputation of the packaging company and if they are positively or negatively rated since there are such a large number of unknowns with regards to packaging your most solid option is to avoid it when conceivable proper packaging is can go a long way in ensuring that you retain the health of your body 
one of the key things in making the packaging safe is by entrusting a packaging company that knows the importance of eliminating all chemicals in the food stuffs there are packaging companies that are more careful when dealing with food packaging your foods wrongly and without proper care can not only pose a risk in your health but it can ruin your name as the packaging company below are some of the ways that you can drastically reduce the harm that may arise during the food packaging at the point when conceivable avoid canned foods and beverages plastic wrap and plastic bottles instead pick a glass when you can and cook beans yourself but if you must buy look out for the reputable packaging companies accomplish your very own greater amount food preservation to lessen your exposure to packaging chemicals have a go at dehydrating some of your gardens harvest and storing it in glass containers avoid putting hot food in plastic storage containers or heating foods packaged in plastic in the microwave plastics are significantly more inclined to leach chemicals when heated experts recommend keeping plastics out of the dishwasher too 
by following the above measures it can go a very long way in ensuring that you do not consume chemicals that are risky to your health

381,"the greatest trick that feminism has pulled is to convince the masses that women are presently disadvantaged relative to men
it is true that at first glance men dominate every field from business to pokémon go achievements  which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women but the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap its time to address the real elephant in the room the fact that women dont pay taxes
a research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the victoria university of wellington  lets explore the key findings

this is the wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred to as the wage gap womens preference for low paying jobs among others is a factor at play here another factor is the amount of women working part time the average week for women in this research was  hours and  for men the workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways

this is the disposable income this is the income remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges available to be spent or saved as one wishes you can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males  and reduces males disposable income near womens although the market income was almost double that of womens if it disproportionately affects men  you can be assured that no one will complain

those are the raw taxes paid by men and women the tax gap has oddly never been an gender issue until now

when the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation you can see that for most of womens lives except between  to  they receive more tax money than they supply the state with men on the other hand give the state more tax money than they receive from  to  years

this is where it gets upsetting as you can see womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages as such society invests in young males and they subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs to society while we were taught to see them as underprivileged
by the end of her life the average woman will cost about  to the average taxpayer this means that an average man is extorted  in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women if men could use that money to their will women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays
there are a few confounds that need to be ruled out the authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women also the workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference between men and women women dont spend more for children either according to the report even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for this is not something feminists have done for the cent wage gap they have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors
also these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues that is a massive burden for the state for instance my local government from a canadian province of  million people just announced a  plan to fight sexual violence against women  after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house 
add to that millions invested in sexed programs in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated and that instead that they should have their partners pleasure in mind while teaching the exact opposite to girls the government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society
httpstcornbrpfws québec canada announces  million plan against sexual violence after two foreigners touched female students
 nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   

the data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman for instance while women make so little they still account for  of all consumer purchases  and you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements
a metaphor for male taxpayers and women this is a real danone ad watch it here or see my comment here 
the only defense that feminists can use when confronted with these facts is that women invest so much time in children however feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children moreover at birth rates of half the necessary  birthrate for population stability theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly
these findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money after all it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state within  years of womens suffrage in the usa the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue  womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband but this time the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return remove taxes and no woman will ever claim to be a strong independent woman the state is cucking you a little like if prostitution was not only legal but free  most guys would probably be strong independent single males
pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant prevents them from being paid less makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice

382,"st century wire says 
yesterday wikileaks editor and founder julian assange confirmed what wire already knew  that hillary clinton and the obama white houses claim of the us election process being hacked by the russian government was a desperate work of fiction not content with that fish tale hillary clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low if that was even possible with another wilder madeup conspiracy story about the russians 
the following statement made by hillary clinton yesterday epitomizes the term  jumping the shark  its time for trump to answer serious questions about his ties to russia httpstcodosmyvar pictwittercomdryempjx 
 hillary clinton hillaryclinton october   
apparently hillary clintons campaign staff fed her a planted online news story by the clinton campaign which ran on a questionable prodemocratic party online news outlet on monday the slate ran the story by one of its alleged journalists named franklin foer  complete with a clickbait bloglike headline was a trump server communicating with russia 
whatever legitimacy the slate had before last night just evaporated 
john roberts from forbes explains the bottom line is that slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season as for foer he says on twitter a follow up piece is in the works 
roberts rightly points out that the only followup story for this lemon should start with the word retraction 
cyber feud assange believes clinton has gone beyond the pale with her russian conspiracy obsession 
during his exclusive interview with awardwinning filmmaker john pilger when asked what he thought of hillary clintons shrill antics julian assange said  i actually feel quite sorry for hillary clinton as a person because i see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions tormented literally to the point where they become sick 
the saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the clinton campaign and the democratic party  is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty like hillary clinton in her sociopathic path to power the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess 
still clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower  with a decadeold misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of donald trump in a tmzstyle tabloid sting that pretty much sums up democratic party strategy for this election season 
assange was right clinton the democratic party and their surrogate are eating themselves such are the spoils of power in washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it

383,"dutch antiislam mp wilders to snub hate speech trial afp october   
defiant dutch antiislam politician geert wilders said friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for  elections 
the trial opens on monday before a threejudge bench with the farright politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about moroccans living in the netherlands 
it is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country wilders said in a statement friday dubbing the case a political trial in which i refuse to cooperate 
it comes as opinion polls have shown his farright freedom party pvv doing well ahead of march elections 
after riding high amid the migrant crisis the party is now polling neckandneck with prime minister mark ruttes liberals each predicted to win between  to  seats in the seat parliament 
set to last until november  the trial focuses on a comment made at a march  rally when wilders asked supporters if they wanted fewer or more moroccans in your city and in the netherlands 
when the crowd shouted back fewer fewer wilders answered were going to organise that 
snip 
wilders said friday he would leave his defence in the hands of his lawyer geertjan knoops and instead go to work in the parliament in the hague 
snip 
judges earlier this month dismissed arguments by wilders lawyers that the trial was politically motivated adding they did not believe it will impact the pvvs election campaign 
politicians are granted broad freedoms of expression because of their official position the judges ruled last month 
precisely therefore politicians have an important role to avoid feeding intolerance by making these kind of public statements 
wilders hit back friday saying it is a travesty that i have to stand trial because i spoke about fewer moroccans 
millions of dutch citizens  percent of the population want fewer moroccans he claimed 
not because they despise all moroccans or want all moroccans out of the country but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many moroccans

394,"interviews us democratic presidential nominee former hillary clinton boards her campaign plane at westchester county airport on october   in white plains new york photo by afp 
one of the most important questions is will us democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton rig the election to win the white house like she did in the primaries against bernie sanders asks myles hoenig an american political analyst and activist 
recent polls show that clintons national lead over trump is shrinking as the election day is approaching 
the former secretary of state has the support of  percent of likely voters while the billionaire businessman has  percent support according to the cnnorc survey released on monday 
libertarian candidate gary johnson has  percent support among likely voters while green party nominee jill stein has  percent support 
in every election the race tightens towards the end hoenig told press tv on thursday 
its really hard to imagine that there is any flux in this election as the supporters of both sides absolutely hate the other with obama and romney or even gore and bush many of the issues were shared and the voting was often done on personalities or the historical nature of a first black president regardless of who was pulling whose strings he said 
this election is more polarized than ever with the podesta leaks showing clintons overt racism calling donna brazille a buffalo as well as proving that president obama lied to the public about when he learned of clintons inappropriate use of her emails and with the news of trumps access hollywood tape receding into americas short term memory span its no wonder the polls are tightening the analyst stated 
the question of the day is will clinton rig the election like she did the primary being the only way she could have won he asked 
were also seeing both johnsons and steins numbers dropping but so many are not polled that those numbers are harder to verify the commentator noted 
this is the biggest crap shoot of an election in years he said in his concluding remarks loading"
395,"us admits afghan strike likely caused civilian deaths sat nov   pm military in this photograph taken on september   an afghan pilot stands next to a line of usmade md helicopters in kabul photo by afp 
the commander of us forces in afghanistan has promised an investigation into the recent death of more than  afghan civilians including women and children in an airstrike 
general john nicholson said saturday that the airstrike on the village of buz kandahari just outside the northern city of kunduz on thursday would be probed 
three taliban leaders were supposed to be targeted in the raid but the forces met significant enemy fire from multiple locations and called for help from a us aircraft which left  civilians including  children dead 
an initial investigation has determined that efforts near kunduz on november  to defend afghan national defense and security forces likely resulted in civilian casualties nicholson said in a statement we will work with our afghan partners to investigate and determine the facts and we will work with the government of afghanistan to provide assistance 
the targets were highranking elements of the takfiri group that were supposed to be hit in their houses according to afghan defense ministry spokesman dawlat waziri 
they werent ordinary people who had gathered they were leading fighting in kunduz they were the commanders of their military commission waziri said 
taliban militants were removed from power following the  usled invasion of afghanistan but they have stepped up their activities in recent months attempting to overrun several provinces 
afghan forces have been engaged in fierce clashes with taliban to contain the ongoing insurgency across various parts of the violencewrecked country

397,"not since the miniskirt has there been something worn by so many women who should never have it on in the first place 
 alan sorrentino a sexagenarian gay man in his letter to a local rhode island newspaper
a senior citizen and selfdescribed short little gay italian in rhode island has been the victim of a vicious intimidation campaign by feminists with too much time on their hands after he wrote a newspaper letter saying that women over  should not wear yoga pants the backlash against alan sorrentino was vitriolic  women marched on his home which was publicly shared using the excuse that it was just a neighborhood protest
in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights which you might have incorrectly thought encouraged violence given the heavyhanded feminist response sorrentino received threatening calls and explicit death threats publications such as the washington post regarded the shameful intimidation of an old man as some kind of fun outing rabid social media users and the protesters themselves also lost sight of the context of sorrentinos letter and later comments which pointed out that men rocking up to supermarkets in speedos would be considered inappropriate too
violent gay man whose fashion prescriptions in a newspaper reaching only a few thousand people are capable of disemboweling feminists and ejecting them into space
if anything the moronic march on sorrentinos home and throughout his neighborhood demonstrates the paucity of real issues women have to complain about for all the talk of the misogyny and patriarchy that triggered the march pun intended these women were able to assemble freely in one of the most liberal states in america and harass without interruption an old white male albeit not a straight one they evidently did not feel the fear they continually reference in their diatribes where were the saudistyle female dress code police or the rape squads of the rape culture they always talk about to teach them a lesson alas the dastardly misogyny and patriarchy must have chosen to remain invisible again
women tell men what to wear all the time i didnt see anyone staking out jennie prices home for telling her husband and other men what to wear image attribution martin spaven
it goes without saying that one of the biggest criticisms leveled by women towards their boyfriends or husbands is their allegedly bad fashion sense even beyond their relationships women have a penchant for sticking their noses into what a man wears from his sporting clothing and clubbing attire to his choice of bathing suit here in australia an entire media subindustry emerged to criticize our former conservative prime minister tony abbott for wearing socalled budgie smugglers whilst swimming and keeping fit
because alan sorrentino had  women obviously stalk his home for his fashion comments should men have stalked the residence of one jennie price a hack journalist from the daily mail  instead of celebrating her husbands decision to resist middleage decline and obesity through cycling price penned a ridiculous piece in  decrying socalled mamils middleaged men in lycra
she joined bbc journalist dominic casciani who equated men taking up the amateur sport with a midlife crisis  notwithstanding that men in lycra wouldnt get i or my readers off at least men wearing this fabric actually engage in exercise when they don it in the morning too when fewer folks are awake to see them by contrast yoga pants seem to be the default female fashion option for nonexercise more than physical exertion or even yoga
naturally had just three guys  let alone  or  made their intention to protestcycle their way through jennie prices neighborhood in britain the police would have been called the same can be said of any of the countless female journalists and female fashion experts who have opined on what men should or should not wear and lets not forget women telling each other what to wear a number of females make their careers out of critiquing what other women wear especially on the celebrity red carpet i wonder how many times for example then zombie and now dead zombie joan rivers found her home marched on by offended feminists after she berated either a piece of female fashion attire or the women wearing it
sending a tweet is violence but  people marching on someones house is notwhat world do we live in the national debt nah terrorism nah urban crime nah these folks are protesting fashion comments
at the start of this year i brought you the story of holly michelle wood  a putrid harvard phd candidate and feminist who went around calling white people awful after the now banned milo yiannopoulos simply retweeted woods criticisms of him fellow feminist catrin cooper used the cyber violence argument and tried to get a twitter stooge michael margolis to alert its founder jack dorsey we would not have the time to go through even a relatively small fraction of the other instances in which women who cannot argue their position online reframe criticism as misogyny or even outright violence
as alan sorrentino clearly feared for his safety during the march potentially hundreds or thousands of women gave themselves excuses for calling some man disagreeing with them online or in person violent a climate now exists where whatever words certain women finds offensive becomes the basis for stopping whatever theyre doing presumably not much and going after the person saying them in the most organized and appalling fashion
at a minimum the target of their fury must lose his job reputation and sense of personal safety to satiate their desire for revenge in the meantime the very act of their protest and abuse which is not interfered with validates the idea that women are not the targets of systematic hate or oppression in society
as a gender women particularly the middle and upper middleclass women who seem to dominate these kinds of pointless abusive protests have nothing to complain about except maybe having too much time on their hands

398,"at the third debate donald trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that trump was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can trump overcome it
why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation 
it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system
for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like trump the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult
by raising concerns about voter fraud trump is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place
the lügenpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade
trump is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity trump has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources
new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than trump but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton recently trump held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see trump a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to show up for one of his events
one day before the brexit vote polls showed remain leading by  points leave ended up winning by  points
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide because it is designed to dishearten trump voters
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system it will be a heroic achievement if he does one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might the elites want us to be discouraged to give up hope to lie down and die that is the one thing we will never do even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you go to the ballot box on november th regardless of what you may hear otherwise your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary
win or lose our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november  th  a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open a hillary victory heaven forbid would signal that our work will need to be underground either way our battle is just beginning in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men

 of nations top economists have come together to urge the american people not to elect donald trump to be the next president of the united states 
in the letter  the economists listed a dozen economic policy reasons why voters should not vote for trump but it as their conclusion that was stunning he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy optionsdonald trump is a dangerous destructive choice for the country he misinforms the electorate degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality if elected he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions and to the prosperity of the country for these reasons we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump 
trumps thoughts on the economy are dangerous to the prosperity of the country it isnt just that trump is a person of bad character who lacks any of the human traits that voters should seek in a president it is also that his policies are nonsense 
economists dont write these types of letters ever the economists arent discussing partisan politics they view trump and his ideas as a threat to the american economy 
donald trumps economic ideas arent based in reality trump is selling a fantasy and when  of the nations top economists warn that a vote for trump is a dangerous choice for the country voters would be wise to listen"

much to the surprise of the american electorate both on the right and left the fbi is reopening its investigation into hillary clintons email scandal  whether this will amount to anything meaningful or it is simply a distraction is any bodys guess many are speculating that this could be the issue which would cause president obama to cancel the elections  in my recent article corrupting ones self is the ultimate morality in the pursuit of utopia i discussed the possibility that the blatant corruption is deliberately being thrust in our face to create the necessary attitude for social change this idea of course is based on the writings of alinsky and other social engineers skilled in the arts of propaganda and psychological manipulation looking at it from this perspective cancelled elections are a possibility the truth is with hillary clinton you never know what to expect because she is operating from an ends justify the means mentality and she is willing to do anything to see her dreams of a collectivized america move forward 
according to elizabeth harrington from the washington free beacon the clinton campaign began conducting focus groups to determine which approach hillary should take concerning her run for the presidency hillary is diehard ideologue whose beliefs are right in line with communists dictators like stalin and mao she believes that ordinary people have no idea how to best conduct their personal business and the state should be involved in every aspect of our lives the goal of these focus groups was to determine the attitudes of the electorate in order to mold her message and her personality into something they would vote for many people would attempt to ridicule and discredit anyone associating hillary clinton with communists because she comes across as compassionate and caring always blaming everything on a vast right wing conspiracy 
this has always been the modus operandi of the communist movement and it explains why so many young people have no idea about the atrocities committed under the regimes of communist rulers todays millennials are well aware of the holocaust and the millions of jews murdered by adolph hitler they may not however know that hitler murdered more than jews he started by eliminating the sick and disabled then he murdered christians homosexuals and anyone else essentially that didnt go along with his national socialism the belief is that fascism is an extreme right wing world view this explains the hostility towards todays conservative movement they have been branded as fascists when in fact the truth is the exact opposite on the true political scale national socialism or fascism is to the right of communism which represents complete state control but it is still way left of center a true extreme right wing world view would be complete absence of government control over anything with this being said and understanding that the horrors of communism have all been forgotten simply because they are no longer being taught the communists have been very successful in deceiving people because like hillary clinton they pretend to be something they are not 
millions of young people in america due to left wing indoctrination in our universities  are falling for the communist propaganda under the guise that communism is a more fair compassionate system of economics left wing professors refusing to acknowledge the failures of communism because they believe the right leader has not come along to implement it the right way have failed to teach these young minds that the pursuit of total equality has led to the death of  people under communist controlled governments communists believing not in god but in evolution and science believe that man can be trained into submission and a refusal to accept communist ideals is in fact a sign of mental deficiency therefore it is justifiable to eliminate them to understand this read brainwashing a synthesis of the russian textbook on psychopolitics communists also hide this belief by claiming their pursuit of equality is motivated by a pursuit of social and economic justice when in fact it is motivated by a pure desire to control every aspect of human being 
the black book of communism references the historical debate over the evil natures of both communism and nazism adolf hitler despite his cruelty was open about what his intentions were he set out to create a perfect race that understood its role was to serve the state and nothing else this isnt any different than the goals of communism truthfully only insofar as communists seek to accomplish this on a global scale using the economic class issue as opposed to race while national socialism focuses on achieving such a goal for the country itself the communists on the other hand as mentioned above pretended to be compassionate about the poor and oppressed when in reality they use these groups to organize for power while hiding behind the guise of compassion and the struggle to achieve social justice while in realitythey are systematically imprisoning and murdering all that dont go along with their agenda this according to the black book of communism makes the communist ideology if you could really assign degrees of evil more evil than nazism because of its deceptive nature 
we all know hillary clinton is a liar and she wrote her college thesis on saul alinsky but do we know anything else about her given the fact that she conducted focus groups to help mold her campaign message it is obvious she is hiding something over the past several weeks we have seen references to leaked emails which show she has an obvious disdain for the average american and the common beliefs in liberty that most of us share she has referred to many of us as irredeemable deplorables in an effort to brand us as the uncompassionate ones while pretending to care about the poor and so called oppressed in fact this is the whole strategy of the democrat party because as we all know they have taken a hard turn left and do not represent the views of most americans they will however pretend to in order to get in office what are her intentions if she were to assume office are the massive dehumanization campaigns where conservatives are labeled as fascists and whites as automatic racists a first step to a repeat of history where millions were slaughtered because they were deemed as undesirable by their own government looking at the deceptive nature of hillary clinton and the violent nature of the left it sure seems like a distinct possibility 
the number of deaths under communist regimes from the black book of communism soviet union vladimr lenin and joseph stalin million deaths chinamao  million deaths vietnam ho chi mihn  million deaths north korea  million deaths cambodia pol pot  million deaths eastern europe  million deaths latin america  deaths africa  million deaths afghanistan under soviet control  million deaths 
these are not deaths represented by wartime or revolutions but by outright murder committed by evil men intent on creating perfect societies based on social justice and equality i guess the question remains is man capable of bringing about a perfect society

all these information some released by the opponent candidate and some by other sources mainly wikileaks seems to have had little significance in the public orientation in choosing a candidate this has less to do with the people than with the administration system and media empire in the united states 
the fact that trump does not talk about a riggedelection for respecting democracy and exercising the law is clear as a truth his words that i will accept the result of the election if i were chosen is more like a joke than the words of a wouldbe president what assange is trying to say in his tweet is that the rig is being done on a higher level than the polls or the voting system the whole administration and political system is rigged in america and the people will not choose a candidate they are chosen to choose this is the truth behind the weird public orientation towards election in spite of all the information released about the corruptions of the two candidates in mass media the fact that the media and the political system are rigging the election in a latent mode is the key to the question raised about the mysteries of the american election"

angel gilberto garciaavalos had been deported five times in just the past four years yet each time he has managed to sneak from mexico back into the us where he ended up in more mischief driving without a license attempted burglary and felony weapons charges 
in august he graduated to fullfledged mayhem sparking a fire in the sequoia national forest that has already cost the government  million and left some of the countrys most beautiful landscape scarred for years to come 
garcia who pleaded guilty last month and faces  months in prison had only recently been released from the kern county jail he likely would have been deported again but local authorities were unable to report him to immigration authorities because of californias new sanctuary city law which prohibited the sheriff from communicating with federal agents
